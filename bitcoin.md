**[Did you know you can generate a Bitcoin private key using a coin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pf234m/did_you_know_you_can_generate_a_bitcoin_private/)**

Most people let their wallet software generate their private key, which is totally fine but Bitcoin doesn’t require a computer to create one. A Bitcoin private key is just a 256-bit number… And a fair coin flip produces 1 bit of entropy. So in theory (and in practice), you can generate a completely valid, secure Bitcoin private key by doing: Heads = 1 Tails = 0 The math is simple. 256 coin flips is 2^256 potential outcomes. Once you have your 256-bit binary sequence, you can convert it offline into: hex format WIF private key or even a BIP39 seed phrase All without touching the internet. You could also do this with dice, a dice roll is roughly 2.585 bits of entropy. Therefore 99-100 dice rolls will give you enough entropy for a 256 bit private key. This works because Bitcoin’s security comes from math. I mean how could you not love Bitcoin!

**[BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Sheds $2.7 Billion in Record Outflows Run](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-sheds-2-081140067.html)**

Investors yanked more than $2.7 billion from the exchange-traded fund over the five weeks to Nov. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The IBIT fund oversees more than $71 billion in assets and has served as the flagship vehicle for traditional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin.  The sustained period of outflows aligns with Bitcoin’s slide into a bear market following a severe liquidation event in early October, which kicked off a more than $1 trillion wipeout in crypto market value.
