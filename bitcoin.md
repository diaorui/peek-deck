**[I Use Value Averaging Instead of DCA - Here’s Why It Works Better](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pfovap/i_use_value_averaging_instead_of_dca_heres_why_it/)**

You see a lot of “just DCA bro” advice on here.Nothing wrong with DCA it’s simple and beginner-friendly but I moved to Value Averaging this cycle, and the results have been way better. Most people know DCA because it’s simple: buy the same amount every week.But when you’re trying to get better prices and make the market’s volatility work for you, Value Averaging is a much stronger method. Let me show you exactly how it played out using real BTC price action from 2024–2025. Rule I Followed Every 15% drop in BTC : Buy. First Buy = $1,000 Second Buy = $2,000 Third Buy = 3000$ Continues..... BTC gave three clean 30% corrections this cycle, so this rule activated six times. Drawdown 1 — March 2024 (-30%) BTC dropped twice by 15%, so we can bought: $1,000 ( Buy 01 ) $2,000 ( Buy 02 ) Later, when BTC reached what I marked as “Top 3,” these were the gains: $1,000 → +95% = +$950 $2,000 → +131% = +$2,620 Total = $3,570 profit Drawdown 2 — December 2024 (-30%) Same plan again: $1,000 ( Buy 03 ) $2000 ( Buy 04 ) During the recovery toward Top 3, three positions were still showing: +$950 ( Buy 01 ) +$2620 ( Buy 02 ) +$330 ( Buy 03 ) +$1140 ( Buy 04 ) Total = $5,040 profit Current Drawdown — 2025 July–Oct (-30%) This is where we are right now. Two more buys triggered: Buy 05: $1,000 → currently –14% Buy 06: $2,000 → currently breakeven These are fresh buys, so it’s totally normal that they haven’t recovered yet. Total Structure 6 total buys – 3 × $1,000 – 3 × $2,000 Total invested = $9,000 Right now, even though BTC is still in a ~30% decline: Three positions remain in profit ($420 + $1,300 + $260) One is slightly negative (–$140) Two are at breakeven Overall: still profitable during a drawdown. Why This Beats DCA for Me DCA buys at every price expensive, cheap, doesn’t matter. Value Averaging waits for discounts. You buy more when BTC is cheaper Your average cost drops fast Strong assets recover and reward the early buys Drawdowns become opportunities instead of pain Your risk is distributed intelligently no guessing bottoms. no chasing tops.Just reacting to 15% dips the same way, every time. This is the whole point:

**[Are you concerned about Bitcoin's 4-year cycle?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pf7oou/are_you_concerned_about_bitcoins_4year_cycle/)**

I have never purchased any cryptocurrency; I am more of a stock market person, just wanted to ask the community what your thoughts are on this theory, given that it is a highly speculative asset. The thing is, the other day I did some analysis and, looking at the second image, during the 12 months leading up to the midterms, there is usually a drawdown in the S&P 500, followed by a recovery. Edit: the table was published by Longview Economics on November 28, 2025. In 2026, it seems that both things will coincide (the run-up to the midterms and the $BTC 4-year cycle theory), hence my curiosity.

**[Bullish on Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pfti4e/bullish_on_bitcoin/)**

I'm sure you have all heard this a million times before but this is my story. In 2015 I researched the crap out of Bitcoin and came to the conclusion that it had a lot of potential. I purchased 10 Bitcoins for $225 a piece through Coinbase. I then stored the Bitcoin in a cold wallet and put the address on a piece of paper in my safe. I told myself that I was going to forget I even bought the Bitcoins and that I wasn't going to take that piece of paper out of the safe for 20 years, and at that time it would either be worthless or potentially worth a lot of money. In January of 2017, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed to over $1,000. I had made almost five times my money in a very short time. $10,000 was real money to me at the time as I had kids nearing College age, a lot of bills to pay, etc. As the price of Bitcoin hit almost $1,200 I was feeling very rich. But just as soon as it went to $1,200, it crashed all the way back below 800. I felt as though I had been wiped out almost overnight, as my Bitcoin lost almost a third of its value. Almost as soon as the price crashed below $800, it went back up to $1000. At that time I did what I said I would never do. I took the Bitcoin wallet address out of my safe, put it back in my coinbase account and sold for $1,000 per Bitcoin, turning my less than $2,500 investment into a cool $10 grand. Fast forward to earlier this year when Bitcoin hit $125,000. Talk about a lot of regrets selling those 10 Bitcoin. But I also remembered I still had my coinbase account. Much to my surprise I learned that I had a few sats still in my account. Coinbase had given me a dollar worth of bitcoin when I open the account and at the time Bitcoin was $225. That $1 worth of bitcoin they gave me was now worth over $550, lol. They also gave me another dollar worth of bitcoin for completing a transaction online which I did. The price at that time was around $250. So I was extremely surprised and grateful to see that my $2 worth of free bitcoin was not worth over $1,000. I am now almost 60 years old and approaching retirement. Up until the last couple of months I had done no crypto investing since my first Bitcoin purchase. The money I received from selling my Bitcoin I invested into hard assets such as silver which I really have enjoyed stacking. But stacking silver was a lot more fun when the price was under $25 an ounce. Tom Lee is now saying that retirees are going to start piling into Bitcoin as an alternative asset class. Although I am not yet retired, I feel as though I am living proof of his thesis. I think I have more conviction in Bitcoin now at $90,000 than I did at $225. Even though my Bitcoin Holdings now are a mere fraction of what I had previously, my dollar amount invested is much higher. I am really enjoying stacking crypto now and watching my balances grow. I am investing weekly in Bitcoin through my Strike account. I believe the value of Bitcoin will be significantly higher in the years to come. Good luck everyone!
