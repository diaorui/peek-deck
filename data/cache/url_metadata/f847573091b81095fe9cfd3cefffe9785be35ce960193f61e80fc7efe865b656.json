    "description": "The current downturn in cryptocurrencies commenced once more on Monday, causing Bitcoin and Ethereum to experience steep declines, according to CNBC. This market movement coincides with a wider risk-off mood at the start of the new month. Ben Emons, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Fedwatch Advisors, stated that a massive $400 million exchange liquidation has generally been blamed for Monday's reversal. Experts warn that \"There is still a lot of leverage in Bitcoin out there\" due to the asset class's decentralized and opaque nature, which is leading to continued crypto sell-off pressure.",
