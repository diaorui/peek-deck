    "description": "Investors have pulled $3.5 billion from the US-listed Bitcoin ETFs so far in November, almost equaling the previous monthly record for outflows of $3.6 billion set in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BlackRock Inc.\u2019s Bitcoin fund IBIT, which accounts for about 60% of the cohort\u2019s assets, has registered $2.2 billion in redemptions in November, meaning it will slump to its worst month barring a sharp reversal.  The outflows come with Bitcoin itself set for its worst monthly performance since the crypto industry collapse of 2022, a daisy chain of corporate failures punctuated by the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.",
