    "description": "Vote for us in NPR\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards: npr.org/peopleschoice\u00a0AI is already reshaping how people find work. Fewer entry-level jobs, robot recruiters, and ever-changing new skill requirements all add up to a new, daunting landscape for humans trying to find dignified work.Today on the show: two stories from the edges of a changing labor market. First we\u2019ll assess claims that AI is causing a white collar job apocalypse. What does the data actually say? We meet an economist who has found one small but fascinating way to measure the impact of AI on workers.\u00a0Then, we go face-to-face, or at least voice-to-voice, with AI. We meet a robot recruiter for a job interview and find cause to ask, \u2018When might that actually be preferable to a human recruiter?\u2019Pre-order the Planet Money book and get a free gift. /\u00a0 Subscribe to Planet Money+Listen free: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, the NPR app or anywhere you get podcasts.Facebook / Instagram / TikTok / Our weekly Newsletter.The original Indicator episodes were hosted by Wailin Wong, Darian Woods, and Adrian Ma.
