    "description": "Bitcoin has now shed about a quarter of its value in November, the most for a single month since June 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Despite a pro-crypto White House under US President Donald Trump and surging institutional adoption, Bitcoin has plummeted over 30% since rocketing to a record in early October.  The rout follows a crippling bout of liquidations on Oct. 10 that wiped out $19 billion in leveraged token bets, and in turn erased roughly $1.5 trillion from the combined market value of all cryptocurrencies.",
