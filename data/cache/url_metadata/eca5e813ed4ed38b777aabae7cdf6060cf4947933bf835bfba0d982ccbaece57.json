    "description": "Severe flooding in southern Thailand has killed at least 267 people, with most of the fatalities reported from Hat Yai, the kingdom's largest city in the south. But altered images of relief vehicles transported by train shared online are in fact AI-generated. Google's detection tool indicated the images were created with its AI model, while AFP found parts of the fabricated visuals were overlaid onto unrelated train videos.",
