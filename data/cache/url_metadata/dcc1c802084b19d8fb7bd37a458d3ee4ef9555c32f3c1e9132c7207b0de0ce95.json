    "description": "Companies can create value with agentic AI, but they often start in the wrong place. While it can be tempting to use agentic AI for customer-facing applications, those tend to be complex, messy, and unforgiving of errors\u2014not ideal for agentic AI. Back-end operations, however, are a better fit. A project at a European telecom illustrates what this looks like. Focusing on reducing the time and cost for service calls, the company was able to use agents to reduce resolution time by 60%, save more than a million euros on a recurring annual basis, and significantly improve the company\u2019s net promoter score. This example offers lessons for leaders, but also illuminates the common challenges they\u2019ll need to navigate in this process.",
