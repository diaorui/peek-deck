    "description": "System developed by researchers at MIT CSAIL and LIDS uses rigorous mathematics to ensure robots flex, adapt, and interact with people and objects in a safe and precise way. It helps robots remain flexible and responsive while mathematically guaranteeing they won\u2019t exceed safe force limits.",
