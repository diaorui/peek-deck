It\u2019s taken a lot of trial and error to get it to move smoothly, and I\u2019m still tweaking things, but I\u2019m really happy with how it turned out so far. Would love to hear any thoughts !"

      "description": "Hey guys, I want to do a project where I investigate various control systems for a mobile robot and try and evaluate the optimal one in a given scenario. For example, an idea I had was to build a self-balancing robot (the inverted pendulum one), and place a glass of water on top, then experiment with various control systems such as PID, LQR, etc. Is it even possible to use these different control systems and figure out the best approach, or is PID tuning the best? Would this project be good to try out? Any advice would help as I am relatively new to control theory."

I've tried looking at various options involving 3d printing and Arduino both of which I have some experience in, but I can't find anything that fits my parameters. Controlled over WiFi for range. Camera Can move around Extra points for microphone and speakers."

The evaluation correlates firmware analysis, IaC cloud configuration, FMS data, network traffic, web stack inspection, and live telemetry. Findings include systemic issues such as unauthenticated UDP position broadcasts and a stored XSS leading to session hijacking.

I wrote down the coordinates for every point. What I would like to know is, how can I program the arm so that it moves a certain distance between each coordinate. for example pt 1,0 and 0,1 are 10mm apart, same between 1,0 and 1,0. Thank you !!!"

      "description": "So i used an api to export a valid package for visualization on rviz2 and gazebo harmonic, but the .gszebo file runs with plugins which are deprecated. (That's a problem for the node&topics logic on Ros2jazzy) When i tried to migrate to an sdf file, scale woes complete wrong, enormous models i dont understand where is the problem, gazebo harmonic explicitly process the sdf file in meters while my models where exported in meters precisely. \u00bfIt's the stl format on harmonic+std giving me hard times or is fusion+stl? How can i import my meshes in to gazebo with this method, any other way to import my own models. Thank you for read."
