      "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiR7HhhqMCI The video and specs describe a high-performance humanoid robot designed for dynamic and industrial use cases. Extreme Mobility: Unlike earlier clumsy humanoids, the T800 claims a top speed of 3 m/s (~6.7 mph) and the ability to perform complex movements like flying kicks and capoeira, powered by a massive 450 N\u00b7m of joint torque. Build: It stands at 1.73m (5'8\") and weighs 75kg, constructed from an aviation-grade magnesium-aluminum alloy for durability. Intelligence & Perception: It runs on an upgradable compute core (potentially a Thor chip with 2000 TOPS) and uses 360\u00b0 LiDAR combined with RealSense depth cameras for navigation. Battery: A solid-state 72V battery provides 2-4 hours of endurance. The video titled \"\ud83e\udd16EngineAI has officially unveiled the T800, its new full-sized general-purpose humanoid robot\" serves as the visual confirmation of these capabilities. If you are trying to repost this to the forum where you received the \"post flair\" error, you usually just need to select a category (like \"News,\" \"Robotics,\" or \"Tech Specs\") from a dropdown menu before clicking submit again.
