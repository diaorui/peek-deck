      "description": "Hi r/robotics, I'm part of a team developing an AI agentic robot, and we're conducting early-stage research. We're looking for honest technical feedback from people who understand robotics systems, LLM integration, and hardware development. Core technical approach: LLM-driven streaming orchestration that enables reasoning-while-acting (not pre-scripted behavior trees) Memory-personality framework for dynamic character development Modular hardware architecture - the intelligence core can be ported across different physical platforms Multi-component coordination (limbs, displays, audio I/O) through parallel/sequential execution logic Current prototype: Quadruped desktop robot with 12 servo motors, multimodal I/O (camera, mic, speaker, display). The survey includes a technical preview video showing the system in action - real-time generative motion and natural language control, not cherry-picked demos. Why we're here: We need reality checks from practitioners. What we're really asking: Does this approach solve problems you actually care about? What are the deal-breakers or red flags? Where would you want extensibility vs. polish? Would you engage with an open development community around this? The survey (5-7 min) covers technical priorities, implementation concerns, pricing sensitivity, and community ecosystem interest. Survey Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDLqMYeSSLKSowCh-Y3n-22_hiT6PWNiRyjuW3mgT67e4_QQ/viewform?usp=dialog This is genuine early research - critical feedback is more valuable than enthusiasm. Happy to discuss technical details in comments."
