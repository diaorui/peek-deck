      "description": "Videoshows a driverless Waymo entering a police felony stop perimeter in Downtown LA. The Incident: The vehicle navigated just a few feet from officers during a tense standoff while a suspect was on the ground. The Failure: The planner technically worked (it didn't hit anyone) but it completely failed to read the room. It highlights that current AVs have zero concept of danger or social context beyond basic geometry. Outcome: Passengers were safe, but officers had to shout commands at a car that couldn't understand the urgency.

It started as a fun idea and somehow turned into a physics sandbox where you can drive robots without installing anything. I want to add a few more robot types, but I\u2019m not sure what would actually be fun or interesting to try. What robots should I add next? Just curious what people here would enjoy testing."
