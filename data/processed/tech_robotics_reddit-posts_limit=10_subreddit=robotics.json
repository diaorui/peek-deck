      "description": "So i used an api to export a valid package for visualization on rviz2 and gazebo harmonic, but the .gszebo file runs with plugins which are deprecated. (That's a problem for the node&topics logic on Ros2jazzy) When i tried to migrate to an sdf file, scale woes complete wrong, enormous models i dont understand where is the problem, gazebo harmonic explicitly process the sdf file in meters while my models where exported in meters precisely. \u00bfIt's the stl format on harmonic+std giving me hard times or is fusion+stl? How can i import my meshes in to gazebo with this method, any other way to import my own models. Thank you for read."

      "description": "Hi guys. I have an upcoming project in school where I have to draw 3 letters using the KUKA arm and a marker. I created an autocad drawing of the 3 letters on a 60x30 grid. I wrote down the coordinates for every point. What I would like to know is, how can I program the arm so that it moves a certain distance between each coordinate. for example pt 1,0 and 0,1 are 10mm apart, same between 1,0 and 1,0. Thank you !!!"

      "description": "Hi! I'm extremely new to robotics but as part of a competition I was entering for amateur school students, we were planning on using omni wheels (not mecanum but instead the wheels with rollers patterned around). I (as I have some CAD experience) have been given the duty of designing these in Fusion 360, however, I'm not 100% sure on the attachment mechanism for the rollers and the pins. Taking some inspiration from a blog post (see image down below) I wanted to do a similar thing. However I have a few questions.... how are the rollers kept from moving along the axle pin and how is the axle pin made stable, I'm just not sure how to design it. Notes: even though I am taking inspiration from the diagram , I am not specifically talking about how it works in the diagram as I know that may be hard to diagnose, I am speaking more generally I have attempted something myself (see second photo) but the roller and roller pin was all one, which I realised wouldnt work as the dimensions for the pin fit exactly which would not allow it to rotate and if it was loose it would be useless. Sorry for my spaghetti ADHD writing! Any help appreciated! Thank youuuuuu. https://preview.redd.it/7zqu8v1vb14g1.png?width=1764&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0d0173042305196e65f9c4c981d93a11df82fce https://preview.redd.it/ota6d4g0c14g1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=ded73ccc834ff9e79e1357e2b730ad15f32cfbae"
