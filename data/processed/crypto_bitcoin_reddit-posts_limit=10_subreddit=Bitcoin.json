      "description": "Since I could cycle, I did, anywhere I could. To school, college, work, it didn't matter. Then I grew up, got a car, a career, a house and a family. My passion to cycle was replaced with a different purpose, a need to provide and as any proud father, that's exactly what I did. Recently I unlocked some of my gains and put it to good use. For you it might just a bike. For me, it's a daily reminder of what bitcoin has done for me. Robin Williams once said riding his bike is the closest we can get to flying. Damn, he was so right! Ignore the fud. Stay positive and hodl."

If you\u2019re a buy-only, long-term holder, what was the moment that made it click for you? Was it understanding the fixed supply? Learning about monetary history? Seeing how fiat keeps losing value? Or something personal? Curious to hear your stories."
