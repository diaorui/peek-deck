      "description": "I have never purchased any cryptocurrency; I am more of a stock market person, just wanted to ask the community what your thoughts are on this theory, given that it is a highly speculative asset. The thing is, the other day I did some analysis and, looking at the second image, during the 12 months leading up to the midterms, there is usually a drawdown in the S&P 500, followed by a recovery. Edit: the table was published by Longview Economics on November 28, 2025. In 2026, it seems that both things will coincide (the run-up to the midterms and the $BTC 4-year cycle theory), hence my curiosity."

      "description": "Charts like this always remind me why time in the market beats timing the market. Short-term traders panic on every red candle, but the data is brutally simple: the longer you hold Bitcoin, the lower your chances of losing money, dropping to basically 0% after 3+ years. Most of the fear comes from weak hands and over-leveraged gamblers who treat volatility like a threat instead of a feature. Meanwhile, patient holders just keep stacking and waiting. I watched this morning a Bitget live streamer bought 2 $BTC and i think this will be a gold in the next halving... Bitcoin rewards conviction, not panic."
