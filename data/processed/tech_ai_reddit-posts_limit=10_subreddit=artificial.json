I draft things with a model, clean them up myself, then run them through a detector that gives actual sentence level notes so I can fix any stiff sounding parts.

I say somewhat because everyone is putting AI into everything right now but I thought a TV could be left alone. Is this going to be the next 3D? Will it have a moment then die a death or will the march of AI continue to infect everything regardless of whether there's a use case or not? Curious to hear people's thoughts."
