      "description": "The boom in metal-intensive technologies like data centers and electric vehicles has made it a prime time to be in the US aluminum business. Prices are booming. Part of that is because inside every data center are cooling units, server racks, radiators, and a litany of other pieces and parts made out of aluminum. No wonder demand is high. But data centers guzzle enormous amounts of power, and electricity prices are skyrocketing. In the US alone, electricity demand is expected to grow five to 10 times faster over the next 10 years than it did in the previous decade, per Bank of America. For aluminum smelters, this is a problem."

I wanted feedback on the AI's so I've made a discord server for testing them out, I would like to add this is entirely feee and the only reason I have different tiers is to stop over use and allow certain people to use it more, the discord server does not have any moderation bots, but I will try and moderate it to the best I can, and you just have to ping the AI or reply to a message for it to respond, there are a lot of commands like: /quota /leaderboard /think /search/deep_search, the bot will currently be offline since I'm fixing it, but will be back up in a few hours so most likely by the time you see this: https://discord.gg/yttwQEetz"

Some one told me \"ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and all the other slop factories are what is consuming the overwhelming majority of AI resources.\" but i thought that just normal people asking chat GPT random questions or Grok being some one's waifu was the left overs from other applications. I had thought the servers and AI algorithms were being turned towards education, government, corporate works and other people received de-prioritized access after paying businesses got their needs processed. Am i wrong? Are Chat GPT queries from randos online really the supposed genesis of 20xxs impending water scarcity?"

      "description": "Hey all. I found this sub while researching which AI might be best for helping me think through ideas and provide insights into my writing, so I'm sorry if this question has been asked recently. I don\u2019t know that much about all the different models available and it\u2019s hard for me to choose which one might be best for me when there seems to be many options. What, in your opinion, is the best AI for someone looking for a collaborative research AI \"partner\" to bounce ideas off of? I do not use AI to write, but will sometimes ask ChatGPT for insight into essay drafts or journal entries that feel like they're developing a still-premature idea. I appreciate AI's ability to discern themes, patterns, subtext, and layers of meaning I can't notice on my own, and to suggest different directions I could take with each idea. I like to ask it to suggest other articles/essays written on similar topics. I don't trust ChatGPT's tendency to provide relentlessly positive feedback, but I don't trust any AI to deliver the same quality critique that a human could, so I'm more looking for a model that can help me develop and expand ideas to a point where I can take the work the rest of the way on my own. What do you think?"
