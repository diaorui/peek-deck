      "description": "ChatGPT now has ads (even for Pro) New Nano Banana Pro competitor Telegram launches AI computing network A collection of AI Updates! \ud83e\uddf5 1. ChatGPT starts showing ads on Pro accounts Brand mentions appearing in replies, ads on iOS - even paid subscribers seeing placements. Users are losing it as OpenAI monetizes across even the highest of tiers. 2. Perplexity launches memory feature across all models Remembers threads, interests, preferences for smarter personalized answers - works with their Agent Assistant too. Works across search modes with full user control - auto-disabled in incognito. 3. OpenAI Images V2 Near Launch to Compete with Nano Banana Pro Current image generation is slow with limited editing. New GPT-Image version will match Nano Banana capabilities - faster generation and advanced editing features. Leaked \"ImageGenV2Banner\" in ChatGPT web app confirms imminent release. 4. Gemini Offers Free Pro Plan to Students for Full Year Eligible students get access to Gemini Pro features at no cost for 12 months. Major push to capture student market and build early loyalty. Direct challenge to ChatGPT's education dominance 5. Prime Intellect Launches INTELLECT-3: 100B+ MoE Model with Scaled RL State-of-the-art performance for its size across math, code, and reasoning.

      "description": "I keep seeing people say that AI is a bubble or that it\u2019s overhyped, but every time I use AI tools I seriously don\u2019t get how people believe that. To me it feels like AI is already capable of doing a huge part of many jobs, including some in healthcare like basic analysis, documentation, nutrition planning, explanations, x-rays, etc. And if it keeps improving even a bit, it seems obvious that a lot of tasks could be automated. So I\u2019m wondering why some people are so convinced it\u2019s a bubble that will \u201cburst.\u201d Is it fear of job loss? Just media exaggeration? Real technical limits I\u2019m not aware of? Or just general skepticism? I want to understand the other side. Do you think AI is actually going to collapse, or do you think it\u2019s going to keep growing and eventually replace certain roles or reduce the number of workers needed? Curious to hear different perspectives, especially from people who think AI is overhyped."

OpenAI hasn't publicly acknowledged it is working on selling ads, but it is testing different types of ads, including those related to online shopping, the report said, citing a person with knowledge of its plans."

      "description": "We\u2019ve been working on an Autonomous Agentic AI, and the thing that keeps surprising me is how often performance drops come from ingestion changing quietly in the background, not from embeddings or the retriever. Sometimes the extractor handles a doc differently than it did a month ago. Sometimes the structure collapses. Sometimes small OCR glitches creep in. Or the team updates a file and forgets to re-ingest it. I\u2019ve been diffing extraction outputs over time and checking token count changes, which helps a bit. But I still see drift when different export tools or file types get mixed in. If you\u2019ve run RAG in the wild for a while, what kinds of ingestion surprises have bitten you?"

      "description": "A quick summary: I have not written papers since undergraduate school, but can write well. My wife is getting a graduate degree and is not a great writer. She asked me to edit her paper and I did. Her style is just basically stream of consciousness, not really good with the proper style and formatting of papers. I made a lot of edits. Afterwords I noticed my wife was undoing a lot of the edits I made, in ways that respectfully were much worse. I asked her why. She said when she handed me her paper the AI tool she was using to detect AI was at 0 percent, but after I made my edits to her paper that number had jumped up to 12%. She was fixing the areas that the machine thought looked like AI. I don't care, I'm not insulted. But I feel like this is just a microcosm of what is happening with kids right now, who are probably learning weird and awkward ways to write papers just to make sure they don't get flagged by AI detectors."
