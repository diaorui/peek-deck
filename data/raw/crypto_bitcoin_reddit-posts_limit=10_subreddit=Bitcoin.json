      "description": "I have been sitting on LOADS of cash for the past year. Just waiting for something to crash because I saw all the tariff nonsense. I'm that guy who has been sitting on cash literally since the election, just waiting and watching like a hawk. I always knew I wanted bitcoin, but I have constantly been hesitant to purchase. I am scared at purchasing at the top because you have a lot to lose at the top... but it always keeps going up. Now, we aren't at the top. I really have no excuse and, based on how bitcoin has been fluctuating, I finally have the balls to say that I think this is the floor. I've been watching since October, and I am confident now. (Please don't fuck me Bitcoin.) I invested over 50k. I don't quite own a full bitcoin yet, but I figured \"what the hell.\" It's going to go back up to 120k and even further, and I am going to be happy that my 50k nearly turned into 100k a year or two from now. I think this is the floor folks, but don't quote me. FYI: I was still in grad school (was my last year) when bitcoin fell to 16k and at that time I was telling EVERYONE \"Buy! Please buy if you can! You will be filthy rich!\" Unfortunately, at that time, I had no money saved, and I couldn't invest a thing. Things are different now. Now, I got some goddamn cash. I'm finally in the club. Hodl."
