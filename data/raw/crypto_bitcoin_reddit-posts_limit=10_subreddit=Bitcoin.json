      "description": "Once upon a time I used this app Voyager and that was a lovely little app. I put 1,200 into their VGX coin and turned it into 89k at one point. Thinking this was the future I held, against the advice of many who told me to buy two Bitcoin and pull it off the platform. I didn\u2019t. But in the end I got 7k back. Yay!! Now I\u2019m dipping my toe back in to see if it\u2019s warm and I\u2019m having fun. I got the Coinbase credit card and this is after about a week of spending (I\u2019m moving across the country so lots of expenses) anyone else using the card? Would love to get the $250 BTC bonus if yall are thinking about it. Let me refer you! I only need 5 hahaha which is an insane amount to find. 5 people to sign up for a random credit card. Ok Temu"
