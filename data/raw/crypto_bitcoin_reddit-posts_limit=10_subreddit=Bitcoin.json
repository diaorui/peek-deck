      "description": "Unfortunately, this is the last meme in the series. I have to admit defeat to Bitcoin. After 153 memes/days, Bitcoin has not risen to $200,000. In fact, it has fallen. But that's okay. I hope I was able to entertain you for a long time with good Bitcoin memes and at the same time prove that it is not possible to predict/time BTC. I've collected a whole bunch of Bitcoin memes and wanted to share them with you! <3 Bitcoin doesn't need us. But we need Bitcoin! See you at 200k^^ \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udde1"
