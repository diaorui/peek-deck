      "description": "Times like today can be hard mentally for some of you and that\u2019s alright. It\u2019s part of the process and initiation into Bitcoin. I\u2019ve been in this space for a while and the best advice is to continue to DCA and if you have a little bit of cash buy a bit more. These bear markets is where you are giving a chance to catch up. Bitcoin does this every 4 years (usually more violently) and once we emerge it blows our minds. What helps me is to think bitcoin will hit $1m sooner rather than later. That\u2019s a safe 10x bet knowing central banks are going to print to get out of this financial mess. Lastly get your coins off the exchange into a hard wallet, never share your seed phase, stack sats and stay humble."
