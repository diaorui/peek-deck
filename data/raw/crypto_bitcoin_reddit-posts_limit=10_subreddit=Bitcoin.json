      "description": "tl;dr Hackers broke into Bitfinex in 2016 and stole 120,000 BTC ($75m at the time) directly from customer accounts. Law enforcement recovered 96,000 BTC in 2022, now worth $3.5bn. They returned a bulk of it back to Bitfinex. Bitfinex did not return the bitcoin to its customers, but instead provided them redeemable tokens for the value of the bitcoin at the time it was stolen. (Even worse: \"Redeemable as quickly as we can.\") I usually call people who yell \"not your keys, not your coins\" too alarmist. Exchanges must be held accountable. They are 100% not being held accountable. This should be a massive lawsuit to permanently determine that if bitcoin as property CAN be returned then it MUST be returned, not the value in dollars at time of loss. You can watch the slimy Bitfinex executive explain this directly at 1hr13 in the documentary, by the way."

      "description": "Early 40\u2019s man that has been in BTC since 2017. The longer I\u2019ve been in crypto the more of a BTC maxi I\u2019ve become. I\u2019ve made most of the mistakes along the way which is part of the learning curve most need to take. Today I purchased another .2 at the highest price I\u2019ve bought yet. There are more and more people like me. Who are buying with the intention of not selling for many years, if at all. I\u2019ve personally never sold. Here are three lessons I\u2019d tell my younger self as it seems most people here are in their 20\u2019s. Think longterm. Don\u2019t try to be a trader unless you are an expert. Just buy, store in cold storage and forget for the next 10+ years. In 10 years you won\u2019t remember or care if you bought at 60k, 90k, or 125k. Trying to time the market is just going to mess up your head and you will most likely screw it up. The term HODL has been around for years for a reason, because it works. Invest aggressively in your 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. If I was in my 20\u2019s right now, I\u2019d be doing everything I could to save more fiat to buy more Bitcoin. Don\u2019t buy the new car, nice watch, house or unnecessary credit card debt. The \u201cwe only live once\u201d mentality is all fun and games until you\u2019re over 40 with no assets. It really is wild what compounding and time does if you start early and aggressively. Investing is only \u201cscary\u201d until you realise the money is broken and everything is going up priced in fiat. Your 40 year old self will thank you. FUD will fack you up. You might be sitting here thinking I wish Bitcoin would crash to 40k so I\u2019d buy more. But if / when it does, everything on twitter, TV, YouTube will be telling you it\u2019s going lower. You might buy the big dip and it will dip again 20% as soon as you hit the buy button. This will feel like you are lighting your money on fire.\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udcb8 It will take balls and strong conviction to keep buying on the way down. The last time BTC was at 16k, I had been buying all the way down until I was mentally and emotionally exhausted. Everyone was saying it\u2019s going to 12k and unfortunately I believed them and stopped buying. If we get another deep bear market I\u2019m going aggressive AF. I refuse to make the same mistake a third time. Bitcoin has been a big part of my life over the last 8 years. It\u2019s not easy being a maxi when everyone around you thinks you\u2019re a crazy gambler. I actually hate gambling \ud83c\udfb0. We all take risks in investing and I\u2019d rather take a risk on BTC than just about anything else. I hope these tips help inspire a few young bitcoiners on the climb up. Happy stacking \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd11"
