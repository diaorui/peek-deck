      "description": "It's basic math. Every year thousands of bitcoins are sent to the wrong addresses, owners with cold wallets die, and private keys are lost forever. Right now over 4 million bitcoins are estimated to be lost forever and every year that number rises. So eventually say 300-400 years from now if 90% of Bitcoins end up being permanently lost what happens to the network security if so little transactions are being performed? Wouldn't this decrease the hash rate by A LOT since miners wouldn't make a lot of money from transaction fees?"

      "description": "Last cycle people were claiming at the top of the euphoria that a super-cycle is about to start. I was very sceptic about that idea, because you know it's always gonna crash. However, this time is different. The market never gone through a phase of euphoria. In fact, all price increases were very reasonable and related to real-live adoption. Now the question is, how can the market crash if it hasn't been through the phase of euphoria? The answer is very simple: It won't. There will be no big crash this time. Welcome to the super-cycle."
