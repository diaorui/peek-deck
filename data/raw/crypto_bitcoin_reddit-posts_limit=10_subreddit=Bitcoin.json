      "description": "It's basic math. Every year thousands of bitcoins are sent to the wrong addresses, owners with cold wallets die, and private keys are lost forever. Right now over 4 million bitcoins are estimated to be lost forever and every year that number rises. So eventually say 300-400 years from now if 90% of Bitcoins end up being permanently lost what happens to the network security if so little transactions are being performed? Wouldn't this decrease the hash rate by A LOT since miners wouldn't make a lot of money from transaction fees?"
