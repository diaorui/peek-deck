      "description": "Since I could cycle, I did, anywhere I could. To school, college, work, it didn't matter. Then I grew up, got a car, a career, a house and a family. My passion to cycle was replaced with a different purpose, a need to provide and as any proud father, that's exactly what I did. Recently I unlocked some of my gains and put it to good use. For you it might just a bike. For me, it's a daily reminder of what bitcoin has done for me. Robin Williams once said riding his bike is the closest we can get to flying. Damn, he was so right! Ignore the fud. Stay positive and hodl."

      "description": "I am fairly new to bitcoin, and probably like a lot of us, I got here trying to understand where we are going in terms of macro\u2026. Just wondering where everyone thinks we\u2019re heading towards. How long do you guys think before the debt spirals cause worldwide hyperinflation? I think we\u2019re all on the same page with that pegging fiat to a commodity again is inevitable. Obviously, we\u2019re all bullish on bitcoin, how do you guys think it would play out? Bitcoin standard? Gold standard? Some kind of hybrid? Could there be more precious metals with bitcoin constitute a standard or would that not make any sense? Does anyone has a theory on how it could play out? China is clearly all about good rn, but I feel like most other countries are increasingly interested in bitcoin. what\u2019s the future of fiat? Do you guys think we will just have fiat with commodity backing, or straight up replace all currencies with bitcoin? In which case no other commodity would be needed, only bitcoin. I tend to think that fiat can\u2019t go away completely tho. are you guys concerned about institutions controlling bitcoin? I wonder if as inflation continues to ramp up, and that people have less and less disposable income and just focus on surviving, how will they be able to get bitcoin? Do you guys think most will need to rely on their government for that? Very interested in seeing what the community thinks about all of these things."
