      "description": "tl;dr Hackers broke into Bitfinex in 2016 and stole 120,000 BTC ($75m at the time) directly from customer accounts. Law enforcement recovered 96,000 BTC in 2022, now worth $3.5bn. They returned a bulk of it back to Bitfinex. Bitfinex did not return the bitcoin to its customers, but instead provided them redeemable tokens for the value of the bitcoin at the time it was stolen. (Even worse: \"Redeemable as quickly as we can.\") I usually call people who yell \"not your keys, not your coins\" too alarmist. Exchanges must be held accountable. They are 100% not being held accountable. This should be a massive lawsuit to permanently determine that if bitcoin as property CAN be returned then it MUST be returned, not the value in dollars at time of loss. You can watch the slimy Bitfinex executive explain this directly at 1hr13 in the documentary, by the way."

If a government with that level of control still feels threatened enough to repeat the same warning over and over\u2026 That tells you everything about Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory. I don\u2019t sell. I only buy. Let them ban it every month \u2014 the protocol doesn\u2019t care. Blocks keep coming in every 10 minutes. \u26a1\ufe0f What do you think: Classic FUD or something deeper this time?"
