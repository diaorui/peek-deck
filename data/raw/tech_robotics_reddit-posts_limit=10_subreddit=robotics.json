It\u2019s taken a lot of trial and error to get it to move smoothly, and I\u2019m still tweaking things, but I\u2019m really happy with how it turned out so far. Would love to hear any thoughts !"

      "description": "Many in the RC community haven\u2019t been able to help a lot in these regards. Im struggling to get my servo programmed how I want it to for my RC snow plow and I\u2019m not sure how to program two actuators to act as my angle method so one comes in when the other pushes out and vice versa the other direction. Currently I\u2019m using an RC winch controller board on my RX to TX as my lift actuator and it works. When I tried to program two actuators to do as I wanted with the opposite wires tied together i think wires crossed and shorted the controller board. But I don\u2019t think ot could handle two actuators anyways. I\u2019m really wanting to keep this a simple build using a single battery if possible and on one TX. Any help appreciated. Pics are of my plow."

What do you all think? Any experience with this or suggestions for better gearboxes for a Nema 17 in a robotic arm?"

      "description": "Hey guys, I want to do a project where I investigate various control systems for a mobile robot and try and evaluate the optimal one in a given scenario. For example, an idea I had was to build a self-balancing robot (the inverted pendulum one), and place a glass of water on top, then experiment with various control systems such as PID, LQR, etc. Is it even possible to use these different control systems and figure out the best approach, or is PID tuning the best? Would this project be good to try out? Any advice would help as I am relatively new to control theory."
