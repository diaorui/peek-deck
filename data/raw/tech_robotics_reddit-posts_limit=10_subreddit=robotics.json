      "description": "This is a strictly engineering-focused question \u2014 not about long-term predictions, consumer markets, or sci-fi use cases. Humanoids are getting a lot of visibility lately (Optimus, Unitree H1, XPeng, Atlas, etc.). It made me curious about the actual engineering trade-offs when the target environment is a typical home. From a design and controls standpoint, the two approaches seem to have very different constraints. Potential engineering advantages of humanoid designs: \u2022 human-height workspace \u2022 access to existing tools, handles, and switches \u2022 whole-body manipulation possibilities \u2022 able to navigate human-scale indoor layouts without modifying the environment Potential engineering advantages of non-humanoid mobile manipulators: \u2022 lower BOM and simpler actuation \u2022 fewer DOF \u2192 lower control complexity \u2022 wheels = far fewer failure modes \u2022 lower power requirements \u2022 easier to reach appliance-tier reliability \u2022 more predictable motion (pets/kids safe) You don\u2019t need to frame this in market terms \u2014 I\u2019m mostly trying to build a clearer mental model for ongoing work related to home-environment autonomy. A lot of current projects (mine included) are running into similar failure modes in manipulation, reliability, and task generalization, so I\u2019m curious how others here rank the practical constraints today. From an engineering standpoint, what seems like the real bottleneck right now? \u2022 manipulation robustness? \u2022 cost of reliable hardware? \u2022 locomotion complexity (balancing vs wheeled)? \u2022 or just the number of corner cases in household tasks? Would love to hear how people here think about current, real-world design constraints."

What do you all think? Any experience with this or suggestions for better gearboxes for a Nema 17 in a robotic arm?"

      "description": "Many in the RC community haven\u2019t been able to help a lot in these regards. Im struggling to get my servo programmed how I want it to for my RC snow plow and I\u2019m not sure how to program two actuators to act as my angle method so one comes in when the other pushes out and vice versa the other direction. Currently I\u2019m using an RC winch controller board on my RX to TX as my lift actuator and it works. When I tried to program two actuators to do as I wanted with the opposite wires tied together i think wires crossed and shorted the controller board. But I don\u2019t think ot could handle two actuators anyways. I\u2019m really wanting to keep this a simple build using a single battery if possible and on one TX. Any help appreciated. Pics are of my plow."

      "description": "Robotics guys seem better versed in actuators than RC guys. I\u2019m trying to make it so my RC snow plow has dual linear actuators to angle it left and right, however this works best using two. One to retract while the other extends, and vice versa in the other direction. I currently have another actuator lifting my plow. This is controlled via my trucks only ESC/receiver and using an RC4WD wired winch controller to control the actual lifting mechanism from my spektrum DX5rugged. This is plenty of power to achieve this, even with the angle. However what control module would I need, or what would I need to make this action work? I\u2019d prefer to ditch the servo sooner than later for my angle operation just due to it being jerkier in nature with less stability and control. Do I need a whole separate ESC to control this via my current receiver? Two ESCs with mixing? I\u2019m kind of lost on how to achieve this."
