      "description": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m working at a robotics / physical AI startup and we\u2019re getting ready to release step-by-step a developer-facing Computer Vision API library. It exposes a set of pretrained and finetunable models for robotics and automation use cases, including: 6D object pose estimation 2D/3D object detection Instance & semantic segmentation Anomaly detection Point cloud processing Model training / fine-tuning endpoints Deployment-ready inference APIs Our goal is to make it easier for CV/robotics engineers to prototype and deploy production-grade perception pipelines without having to stitch together dozens of repos. We want to share this with the community to: collect feedback, validate what\u2019s useful / not useful, understand real workflows, and iterate before a wider release. My question: Where would you recommend sharing tools like this to reach CV engineers and robotics developers? Any specific subreddits? Mailing lists or forums you rely on? Discord/Slack communities worth joining? Any niche places where perception folks hang out? If anyone here wants early access to try some of the APIs, drop a comment and I\u2019ll DM you. Thanks a lot, any guidance is appreciated!"
