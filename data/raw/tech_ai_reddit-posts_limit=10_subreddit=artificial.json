      "description": "Dec 1 (Reuters) - OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees he was declaring a \"code red\" to improve ChatGPT and is planning to delay other initiatives, such as advertising, The Information reported on Monday, citing an internal memo. OpenAI hasn't publicly acknowledged it is working on selling ads, but it is testing different types of ads, including those related to online shopping, the report said, citing a person with knowledge of its plans."

      "description": "A quick summary: I have not written papers since undergraduate school, but can write well. My wife is getting a graduate degree and is not a great writer. She asked me to edit her paper and I did. Her style is just basically stream of consciousness, not really good with the proper style and formatting of papers. I made a lot of edits. Afterwords I noticed my wife was undoing a lot of the edits I made, in ways that respectfully were much worse. I asked her why. She said when she handed me her paper the AI tool she was using to detect AI was at 0 percent, but after I made my edits to her paper that number had jumped up to 12%. She was fixing the areas that the machine thought looked like AI. I don't care, I'm not insulted. But I feel like this is just a microcosm of what is happening with kids right now, who are probably learning weird and awkward ways to write papers just to make sure they don't get flagged by AI detectors."

      "description": "We\u2019ve been working on an Autonomous Agentic AI, and the thing that keeps surprising me is how often performance drops come from ingestion changing quietly in the background, not from embeddings or the retriever. Sometimes the extractor handles a doc differently than it did a month ago. Sometimes the structure collapses. Sometimes small OCR glitches creep in. Or the team updates a file and forgets to re-ingest it. I\u2019ve been diffing extraction outputs over time and checking token count changes, which helps a bit. But I still see drift when different export tools or file types get mixed in. If you\u2019ve run RAG in the wild for a while, what kinds of ingestion surprises have bitten you?"
