      "description": "The boom in metal-intensive technologies like data centers and electric vehicles has made it a prime time to be in the US aluminum business. Prices are booming. Part of that is because inside every data center are cooling units, server racks, radiators, and a litany of other pieces and parts made out of aluminum. No wonder demand is high. But data centers guzzle enormous amounts of power, and electricity prices are skyrocketing. In the US alone, electricity demand is expected to grow five to 10 times faster over the next 10 years than it did in the previous decade, per Bank of America. For aluminum smelters, this is a problem."

      "description": "This article discusses the political economy of AI capitalism. It considers AI as a General Purpose Technology (GPT) and argues we need to investigate the power concentration of Big Tech. AI capitalism is characterised by the commodification of data, data extraction and a concentration in hiring of AI talent and compute capacity. This is behind Big Tech\u2019s unstoppable drive for growth, which leads to monopolisation and enclosure under the winner takes all principle. If we consider AI as a GPT\u2014technologies that alter society\u2019s economic and social structures\u2014we need to come up with alternatives in terms of ownership and governance. The commons is proposed as an alternative for thinking about how to organise AI development and how to distribute the value that can be derived from it. Using the commons framework is also a way of giving society a more prominent role in the debate about what we expect from AI and how we should approach it. Keywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), AI capitalism, Political economy, Commodification, Extraction, Commons"
