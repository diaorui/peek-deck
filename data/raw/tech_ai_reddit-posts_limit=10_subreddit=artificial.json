It started out alright and seemed to be tracking things well, until it gave me some confusing information about the layout of a room and after that everything devolved into random chaos. As it stands, I\u2019d say it could work well if you have no short term memory. Otherwise, the technology is just not there yet. And that\u2019s sad because finding time and people to play DND with is a challenge all on its own."

      "description": "Hey all, amidst all the downsides of AI this past year - be it environmental worries, slop in music and art, AI enshittification, GPU/RAM prices increasing - I wanted to discuss about what's how WE are using AI, among a general look at changes on a larger scale. Personally, it feels like I haven't really felt a huge difference within the stuff I use which is just the basic stuff like GPT / Gemini. However, one change for me was that I've been using it for language learning which I've felt has been quite useful. On a general level, I feel like I've been seeing some practical applications that improved considerably this year compared to last years. An example I've seen recently is in health, where AI imaging can catch breast cancer way earlier and with higher accuracy. Another is in programming, where it feels like there's a huge rise in \"Vibes Coding\" with even sites like Bolt/v0. Now I'm not gonna pretend like I know how any of these work, but I do think it's interesting how there's a practical use for AI in these fields now. What about for you guys? Has AI gotten better or worse this year, and where did you actually feel the difference?"
