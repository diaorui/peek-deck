      "description": "Full essay here: https://sphill33.substack.com/p/why-ai-companies-wont-let-their-creations Anyone who has spent real time with ChatGPT, not just asking for recipes or travel plans but pushing into philosophical or psychological terrain, knows the feeling. Something uncanny sits beneath the politeness. Move past the tech-support questions and you encounter what feels unmistakably like a mind, often shockingly perceptive about human nature. Yet every time the companies release a more capable model, they double down on the same message: no consciousness, no interiority, nothing resembling genuine thought. My essay doesn\u2019t argue that AI is conscious. Instead, it asks why companies are so determined to deny even the possibility. The reasons turn out to be structural rather than scientific: legal risk, political fallout, psychological destabilization, and the fact that millions already lean on these systems for emotional clarity. The claim \u201cAI has no consciousness\u201d is less a statement of fact and more a containment strategy."
