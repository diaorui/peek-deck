      "description": "Hey everyone, I am trying to implement an AI Agent in my work to automatically create a project plan. This usually takes a lot of time and I have to manually adapt the plan several times during a project. Obviously, once the agent is set I will have an efficiency boost. But my question ist how you could potentially measure an efficiency increase and how to academically prove this to scale it to different projects. The only 3 options to gain hard facts at the moment are: 1. Measure the total time that I spend with manual plan creation VS. The time that an Ai needs 2. the implementation time of an Ai agent (prompting, programming, api, data etc) 3. Create a cost-benefit-calculation with the information from 1 and 2 4. Use the calculation for scaling in other projects My question to you: Am I missing any option or would you generally measure efficiency gains with Ai agents in another way?"
