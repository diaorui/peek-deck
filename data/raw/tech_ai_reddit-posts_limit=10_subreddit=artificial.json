      "description": "I'm just questioning how to perceive and process the influx of content like this video where the script of the video is so obviously AI generated her phrasing is unnatural on top of her perfect grammar as a non native speaker the obvious 'negated counterpoint, point structure\" the numbered checklist at the end. it is literally a ChatGPT output, interspersed with her own words and thoughts LLMs have changed content overnight and it it never going back i'm already so sick of hearing people read the output verbatim, instead of synthesizing the information they get into their own thoughts. the comments praising her when she didn't think it or write a lot of it, it's just so *eye-roll* i'm sure her art is her own and not AI, i don't really care, she isn't in question here and this video is all i've ever seen of her. But they are her ideas that she prompted to some degree, her examples were obviously her own and based on personal experience, that she used AI to get a script for a video out of. But it of is a certain quality that is so obviously AI, and therefore to me not impressive, yet no one sees it in the comments. Trying to ascertain what parts of someone's speech is AI is mentally unproductive for the most part and could drive one mad, and anecdotally in real life this isn't a problem, because to some degree you have to internally synthesize the information in order to repeat it, which is no different from reading or any other source. playing LLM detective isn't something I do or an interested in, and i have gotten numb to it, this one just got to me for some reason. How does someone stand up against, or rather what can they do to actually add something, in an environment like this? what value can one add that someone can't just prompt? Looking at this, if information / knowledge work is now stunted, personal anecdotes and experiences will have to be more of the angle, so I guess this? I'm sure if she ran the script through an AI humanizer, I wouldn't even be making this post, so maybe it it's AI, but just the phrasing that reminds me it is. \"the robot is just a symbol, what it represents is not a style but a symbol. what is represents is not a style but a visual voice, shaped by my interests ideas and values\" ^ this is an LLM output, not her words \"being cool is not blind rebellion or crowd pleasing but being in alignment with your own convictions\" ^ she opened this with her own \"i started thinking\" but didn't even change the pronoun of the LLM output that followed \"you see two typical patterns, those who ride the hype, and those who oppose labubu to signal so-called superior taste\" ^ this very distinctly ChatGPT labeling with some made up name and systematic categorization of everything. Everyone is talking about image generation ruining feeds and whatever, but to me this is so much worse. so much more insidious. i just hate that people with genuine intelligence and analytical skills, or capacity for self-reflection are so easily masked by the amount of people prompting and regurgitating stuff like this. i miss being impressed by someone's critically thought-out take on something, or novel lateral thinking conclusion they reached, at least as often. i'm scared of the erosion of these skills and it's implications on actually being able to identify actually exceptional or actually interesting people. no hate, it just got me thinking, as this kind of stuff has quickly overwhelmed my feed. just an AI homogenization of \"analysis\" which is ironic and counterproductive."
