      "description": "The boom in metal-intensive technologies like data centers and electric vehicles has made it a prime time to be in the US aluminum business. Prices are booming. Part of that is because inside every data center are cooling units, server racks, radiators, and a litany of other pieces and parts made out of aluminum. No wonder demand is high. But data centers guzzle enormous amounts of power, and electricity prices are skyrocketing. In the US alone, electricity demand is expected to grow five to 10 times faster over the next 10 years than it did in the previous decade, per Bank of America. For aluminum smelters, this is a problem."

Some one told me \"ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and all the other slop factories are what is consuming the overwhelming majority of AI resources.\" but i thought that just normal people asking chat GPT random questions or Grok being some one's waifu was the left overs from other applications. I had thought the servers and AI algorithms were being turned towards education, government, corporate works and other people received de-prioritized access after paying businesses got their needs processed. Am i wrong? Are Chat GPT queries from randos online really the supposed genesis of 20xxs impending water scarcity?"

      "description": "Hey everyone! I just launched OpenClaude.me - a platform that gives you completely free access to all Claude models including Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5. What makes this different from official Claude.ai? All models are available to everyone - No premium subscription needed for Opus 300K tokens daily limit on EACH model - You get full 300K on Opus, full 300K on Sonnet, and full 300K on Haiku. There's no fallback system where you run out on one model and get downgraded Web Search & Code Execution tools included for free Simple signup - Just email and password, no verification wait Mobile responsive - Works smoothly on phones How it works: Just sign up and start using any model you want. The 300K token limit resets daily at midnight. If you somehow manage to hit the limit, you can simply create a new account and keep going (though 300K is pretty generous for daily use). Quick note: Don't ask the AI which model it is - they usually give wrong answers when asked directly. Just test them yourself and you'll feel the difference in capabilities. Future plans: I'm planning to add more features based on your feedback. Eventually, there will be a premium version, but I promise - everything that's free now will stay free. Premium will just add improvements and Claude Code access with 100x the usage limits of official Claude Pro. Why am I sharing this? I want people to test it, use it, and give me as much feedback as possible so I can make this better. This is a community-driven project. Try it out: openclaude.me Let me know what you think!"

      "description": "Hey all. I found this sub while researching which AI might be best for helping me think through ideas and provide insights into my writing, so I'm sorry if this question has been asked recently. I don\u2019t know that much about all the different models available and it\u2019s hard for me to choose which one might be best for me when there seems to be many options. What, in your opinion, is the best AI for someone looking for a collaborative research AI \"partner\" to bounce ideas off of? I do not use AI to write, but will sometimes ask ChatGPT for insight into essay drafts or journal entries that feel like they're developing a still-premature idea. I appreciate AI's ability to discern themes, patterns, subtext, and layers of meaning I can't notice on my own, and to suggest different directions I could take with each idea. I like to ask it to suggest other articles/essays written on similar topics. I don't trust ChatGPT's tendency to provide relentlessly positive feedback, but I don't trust any AI to deliver the same quality critique that a human could, so I'm more looking for a model that can help me develop and expand ideas to a point where I can take the work the rest of the way on my own. What do you think?"
