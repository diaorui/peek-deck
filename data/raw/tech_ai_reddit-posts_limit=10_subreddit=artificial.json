      "description": "\u201cIt failed because we didn\u2019t invest in change management\u201d. This is one I hear a lot from people across the industry. They\u2019re kindof right. Take a minute and think about why IT and data teams leave \u201cchange management\u201d out of their projects\u2026 A: They always want to include \u201cresisters\u201d for \u201cfeedback\u201d - who just create timeline / budget chaos and lots of \u201cno\u201d. There\u2019s no instruction manual on AI so there\u2019s no point. These people aren\u2019t going to adopt early anyway and kick up anxiety for the project team. So leave them out and kick your change people to the curb if they insist upon \u201cbringing everyone along\u201d. This following routinely drives 60% - 90% adoption rates companies. Instead - segment your users into 3 groups: Super early adopters (5% of employees) Learner translators (15% of employees) Reluctants (70%-80%) (Kindof like crossing the chasm groups) The first one gives you high value use cases and 100% participation on pilots (not 10%-20% participation on pilots). Be RUTHLESS about your pilots. If people aren\u2019t participating - kick. them. OUT. and redistribute the licenses. The second group learns from the early adopters, will help you validate what\u2019s useful, and will TEACH everyone else. Keep the use cases simple and high value for the reluctants. Dont throw too much at them. Make it PRESCRIPTIVE (process map, prompts, checklists). Make sure your leaders visibly point to the good work early adopters are doing. This is key - you want FOMO. Triggering the need to fit in is FAR more powerful and productive than bringing people along with each step. As people keep using tools - lean into automation to drive last mile adoption among leaders and laggards."
