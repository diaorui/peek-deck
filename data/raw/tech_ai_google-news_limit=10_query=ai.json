Fewer entry-level jobs, robot recruiters, and ever-changing new skill requirements all add up to a new, daunting landscape for humans trying to find dignified work.Today on the show: two stories from the edges of a changing labor market. First we\u2019ll assess claims that AI is causing a white collar job apocalypse. What does the data actually say? We meet an economist who has found one small but fascinating way to measure the impact of AI on workers.\u00a0Then, we go face-to-face, or at least voice-to-voice, with AI. We meet a robot recruiter for a job interview and find cause to ask, \u2018When might that actually be preferable to a human recruiter?\u2019Pre-order the Planet Money book and get a free gift. /\u00a0 Subscribe to Planet Money+Listen free: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, the NPR app or anywhere you get podcasts.Facebook / Instagram / TikTok / Our weekly Newsletter.The original Indicator episodes were hosted by Wailin Wong, Darian Woods, and Adrian Ma.

But altered images of relief vehicles transported by train shared online are in fact AI-generated. Google's detection tool indicated the images were created with its AI model, while AFP found parts of the fabricated visuals were overlaid onto unrelated train videos."

The culprits? Data centers and cryptocurrency mining. Bills could rise as much as 25 percent in places like Virginia. Science writer Dan Charles explains why electric utilities are adding the cost of data center buildings to their customers\u2019 bills while the data companies pay nothing upfront.\u00a0Read the full June analysis here.To listen to more on the environmental impact of data centers, check out our two-part reported series:-\u00a0Why the true water footprint of AI is so elusive-\u00a0How tech companies could shrink AI's climate footprintInterested in how technology affects everyday life?
