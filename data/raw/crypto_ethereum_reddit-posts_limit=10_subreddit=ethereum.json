      "description": "This is Part Two of the eight-part series: Can I Pay With This? A stablecoin experiment in Buenos Aires Part One: Decentralized or Destitute Money, monkeys and mild terror Part Two: First Contact with Reality <-- you are here KYC on a hostel bunk bed I arrive in Buenos Aires and immediately discover that Twitter has lied to me. Various digital nomads had insisted that there was no need for cash in Buenos Aires anymore. Don't bother bringing dollars or euros. It is true that Argentina is currently in a period of relative exchange stability after years of crippling inflation (for ex, 211% in 2023). Using a foreign credit or debit card then meant you'd get the terrible Official Rate. In reality, everyone used the black market Blue Rate which at times could give you almost double as many pesos for your dollars. But now that the two rates have converged, the Twitterati explained, it is safe to use your cards again. I believed them. Now I have regrets. The taxi app crashes; the driver is happy to take me anyway for the original amount or even a discount, but he will only accept pesos in cash. My hostel wants a cash deposit for the towel. The first coffee shop I walk into has a big sign: We do not take cards. The man at the subway won't let me top up my newly acquired SUBTE card unless I handed over cash pesos. Not to mention restaurants offering discounts ranging from 10% to an eyewatering 25% just for paying with actual paper money. And let's not talk about the obvious scowls if I even think about tipping my server using my card. I need to find out how to get cash, fast. The hostel owner gives the same lecture to every new arrival. Yes, you can get pesos on the black market. However, here are the neighbourhoods that you must not enter if you value your life. Keep your money in your pocket whenever you are outside. Don't take selfies unless you want to lose your phone. He shrugs confusedly when I ask if I can trade stablecoins for pesos. I need dollars, he tells me. Once he's convinced that I'm taking him seriously, he gives me directions to a man in a jewelry shop whom he trusts, who will buy my Euros. Don't trade with anyone outside on the street, he tells me. It's dangerous. I can pay the towel deposit later, don't worry. Just be safe! Don't trade on the street. The streets in question, Calles Lavalle and Florida, are full of men and women calling cambio, cambio, cambio de dolares! every few meters. Mindful of the hostel advice, I ignore them and walk to the jewelry store. A man outside asks if I want to trade and waves me into the tiny shop with an old man sitting with a large cash register. Watches of various values are laid out on the counter. When I ask if they take stablecoins, he actually laughs. I try again: What about debit cards? Only if I wanted to buy a watch. I trade 50 euro for many tens of thousands of pesos. I feel conspicuous carrying this much cash, unsafe. I try not to look vulnerable. I'm crossing a road when a guy walking towards me passes too closely, brushing my shoulder. There was plenty of room and no reason for it. I turn to see who bumped into me and discover he's turned too, standing a few meters behind me, staring at me. As our eyes lock, he turns again and walks away. That evening, another resident tells me that he didn't bother with the owner's instructions. It was easy to get pesos, he says. \"I just walked up to some guy on the street and handed him $500.\" Peer to peer, yes. But I think I'm not that brave. I unpack my three T-shirts and two Android phones and a tablet and a keyboard for the tablet and another travel keyboard, a cute little pink thing that folds up, which I keep in the back pocket of my hoodie, so it is easy access to pull out and use with my phone in coffee shops. The next assignment: wrestle with a pile of Argentine Web3 apps promoted by Devconnect to showcase Argentine innovation. They aren't wrong. Argentina is certainly punching above its weight when it comes to Web3 development. There's an almost romantic backstory there, going back to innovation hubs like Casa Voltaire (2014-2016) which led to actual, very-real projects such as Decentraland and OpenZeppelin. Today, Argentina ranks second in Latin America for Web3 developers, despite having only a fraction of the population of Brazil or Mexico. Grassroots communities such as Ethereum Argentina and Crecimiento are dedicated to transforming the country into LATAM's crypto capital. But when I download the apps, I discover that they are not for meant for me. Lemon Cash and Belo require a national identity number from a South American country. Ripio lists six countries, including Mexico and - unexpectedly - USA residents and non-residents. As a non-resident of the USA, I start filling in their form, which happily accepts my Euro-credentials and then asks me to upload a copy of my W8BEN, which is essentially the IRS asking you to declare that you are not an American, so they can find some other way to punish you. I back out quietly and delete the app. The tablet's keyboard fails on the first day, the bluetooth connection hiccupping and disconnecting. The smaller pink keyboard will work for both phone and tablet, however, and I feel smug that I have built-in redundancy. I get back to work with barely a hitch. I see someone talking about payment solutions on the DevConnect Telegram channel. A new batch of Web3 apps with an elegant premise: use a stablecoin wallet to pay merchants who use the QR-code system in Argentina. Grocery stores, pharmacies and little kiosks that sell novelty mate mugs all accept QR payments, in a system regulated by the Central Bank of Argentina under the Tranferencias 3.0 initiative. It's not quite escaping traditional finance, but the initiative requires that all payment service providers and banks use the same standardized QR code generator. The Web3 apps plug into the QR scaffolding that already exists, allowing me to hold stablecoins (USDC or USDT, depending on the app) and spend in pesos. KYC is required to comply with local regulations. I quickly try Peanut and Yodl, which both offer QR payments for Argentina and Brazil, Yodl also works in Vietnam and the Philippines. To my surprise, the Know Your Customer (KYC) isn't completely soul-crushing. I enter my address, upload my passport screenshot and minutes later I can move money into my wallet using one of a number of Ethereum Layer 2s designed to make transactions faster and cheaper. Both use Arbitrum, which is a relief. Peanut wants USDC, Yodl wants USDT . This isn't to say that I was happy with KYC as a part of my solution. This is the requirement to collect personal identifying data to ensure that you, as a provider, can prove that you \"know your customer\". KYC regulations require that financial applications collect information about their users in order to reduce money laundering and financial fraud, despite billions poured into compliance yearly with little noticeable impact, if any. An additional catch is that many applications use KYC as an excuse to collect additional data or to filter out customers that they don't like. KYC info is often used as an anti-sybil measure. Ether.fi rejected me because I live in a country that they don't want to deal with. And I'm still feeling salty about going through KYC with Monerium when it was in beta, who then informed me that I couldn't have an account because I wasn't notable enough. I am apparently too boring for the future of finance. But also... this KYC is easy for me because I'm exactly who financial systems want to offer accounts to. I have a passport from a country that matters, my name linked to an address that exists on official forms, documentation proving I am who I claim to be. I thought that part of the point of alternative finance was to help those people that banks won't or can't serve. Meanwhile, I'm sitting cross-legged on a hostel bunk, surrounded by charging cables, relying on the hostel's Wi-Fi signal remaining strong enough to upload another photograph of my passport. The future of finance still seems to require centralized government approval. Another issue: So far, everything I've looked at makes me transfer my money from my wallet to theirs. I instinctively want to say that they are custodial. But no: the apps all say that they are self-custodial, which is confusing the hell out of me. I can't link my own wallet. I have to send funds from my wallet to a wallet in their app. How is that self-custody? Peanut uses passkeys, saved with Apple or Google, rather than trusting me to store my own details. There is no way to gain control of the wallet they create on my behalf. Their docs insist that it is self-custodial because they don't actually hold the funds and can't spend them on my behalf. I can kinda see the argument, if what they mean is that thewallet is not custodial. But I don't think \"we can't spend your money for you\" is what self-custody means. Yodl seems better in this regard: they generate an embedded wallet using Privy and apparently it is possible to gain control of the wallet by bypassing Yodl and using Privy options to export your keys. I have no idea how to do this and I had to wade through their terms and conditions to even find that information. Neither app has any option for exporting the wallet or any option at all, other than to submit a transaction to withdraw the funds to another wallet. There are no details on recovery. As of right now, if they disappear overnight, so does my money. On the other hand, I understand that they want to make their apps straight-forward. I appreciate that these middlemen are the only reason that I can buy empanadas without explaining smart contracts to a bakery. They are connecting Web3 to meatspace by plugging into an existing QR system, which is truly useful. I distinctly feel that they don't want to be gatekeepers, they want to be guides. But it doesn't feel right. I'm learning that sometimes words in DeFi don't mean what I think they mean. I consider renaming my challenge. Decentralized-ish with bonus Customer Support or Destitute except for a wallet full of cash and three cards . --- Can I Pay With This?

      "description": "So crypto games have a bad rap in mainstream because of past scams. Also, a lot of them get criticized because of the poor gameplay quality, and because of the fact that they focus more on earning rather than the actual gameplay mechanics (which I agree with). However, using crypto seems beneficial because you can track all of the transactions on the blockchain online (nothing is hidden). If, for example, you do an esports type of tournament with a cash prize pool given to players, you can literally track how that pool is given to players on the blockchain. But without crypto, you have to trust the companies on how the pool is being distributed (because you don't know what their doing behind the scene). Also, the transaction fees with some crypto chains are pretty low (in the milli-cents, compared to using credit cards to buy in-game virtual currencies, like Fortnite VBucks)... But the fact that crypto games haven't taken off tells me that gamers really don't care about transparency and fees...They trust the centralized gaming companies/publishers, and are willing to pay premiums for skins and other in-game assets without being the true owners of those assets. As gamers, do you guys agree with this? Do you see any case where gamers would prefer to transition to crypto instead of traditional credit card systems?"

      "description": "Decentralized or Destitute This is Part One of an eight-part series. Table of Contents 1) Decentralized or Destitute <-- you are here Money, monkeys and mild terror 2) First Contact with Reality KYC on a hostel bunk bed 3) WE ACCEPT BITCOIN (sort of) My first on-chain candy 4) Eighteen Ways to Pay for Ice Cream Stablecoins, FX hell and a missing keyboard 5) Going Bankless From tourist shop hack to cueva contact 6) Trustless, My Ass Trading with the Blue Man 7) Custodial Services Self-custody is easy, luggage custody is hard 8) Apparently I Did It Wrong \"You should have just used X, bro.\" Buenos Aires is a beautiful city of wide avenues, striking architecture and a population that has come to terms with the fact that the peso has been in freefall for decades and banks can't be trusted. The economy is feral. Enter crypto. Devconnect 2025, the World's Fair for Ethereum, will be (or has been, by the time you are reading this) held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Argentina is a place where Ethereum adoption is happening right now. People are using stablecoins and blockchain solutions for daily transactions and savings. Like many people interested in the culture of Ethereum, I have only scratched the surface of Decentralized Finance. DeFi, ranging from yield-bearing accounts to leverage trading to penguin NFTs. Ethereum, I'm told, is digital oil, the beginnings of a system that will change the way we interact with finance the way that the Internet has changed the way we interact with the world. It sounds amazing and futuristic: a sci-fi utopia. But right here, right now, the Ethereum Foundation says that people in Buenos Aires are using these solutions to buy coffee and bread and maybe a little salvation. Could I do that, too? Could I buy asado and wine with stablecoins? Toilet paper? I decide that I need to find out. I'll fly to Argentina and see if I could live on-chain, converting my carefully hoarded store of half an ETH to USDC. There's three parts to this. Decentralized: No single entity is in control. Permissionless: I cannot be denied access. Trustless: I don't need to have faith that the transaction will happen. How close can I get to that dream of the future of finance of walking the sunlit streets with nothing but a digital wallet and my own hunger? I call the challenge Decentralized or Destitute. I pack a backpack with three T-shirts, one pair of jeans and a cheap phone to hold a burner wallet. Also two debit cards, one credit card and an envelope full of cash. Because I am not brave and I've seen what happens to idealists in documentaries. Step one: get a place to sleep using crypto. Booking an apartment directly with a private owner fails immediately. The first person I contact rejects the offer without consideration. \"No cripto.\" Dollar, Euros or Pesos, but absolutely cash only. The second not only doesn't want crypto but doesn't want my business at all, just for asking. I'm going to have to use one of the travel platforms that offer this specifically. Unfortunately, the great savings of up to 60% off for paying with crypto are based on booking hotels of a slightly higher quality than I usually stay at. One excitedly tells me about the perfect place for me! And it's 44% off! Making for a very affordable $619.50 per night with 2% cashback. There seem to be very few options at my actual price range, which is more like $40 a night. Preferably with walls. Betrustly, a brand new booking platform designed for Argentina, gives me hope. I find a perfect room in a large co-living house: private bathroom, working areas, fantastic price and available for the dates I wanted. Except that I never receive a response. Customer support's advice is to book the place directly. They quickly reply to my direct contact: application only, the minimum stay is one month, and no, they do not take crypto. The Ether.fi travel portal finally gives me a break: a private room that actually exists, well-placed, well-priced. But when they say you can pay in crypto, they don't mean that you can pay in crypto. You have to have an Ether.fi card for that perk. Fine, I apply for the card. No. People who live in my country are not invited to the party. Desperate for a solution, I cave and pay with a DeFi card: it's Gnosis Pay, which is self-custodial (they can't lock me out of my finds) and allows me to pay for my hostel booking with stablecoins. Technically a win. But Gnosis Pay is a Visa card. A literal, physical card indistinguishable from the one issued by my bank. It feels like I won using training wheels and corporate logos. Friends and family express only minor concern at my plan. My best friend worries I'll get indoctrinated into a crypto cult. (Plausible.) My mother thinks that I might be in over my head. (Correct.) My aunt is concerned that I might have fallen for a romance scam. (Incorrect, but my DMs are open.) But to my surprise, the most urgent concerns for my safety come from a nurse at the Center for Infectious Diseases. There are no vaccine requirements for Argentina, but my doctor still advises a vist to the infectious disease clinic. I'm an immigrant in a European country where my language skills are somewhere between lost tourist and toddler, which makes this sort of appointment nervewracking. At the front desk, the receptionist asks at full volume what infectious disease I was being treated for and then waves me upstairs to meet with a nurse. I explain to the nurse that I don't speak the local language. She disagrees, pointing out that I'd just said I don't speak the language in the language. Fine. I haltingly explain that I am going to Argentina and sit back, my vocabulary expended. She pulls up a browser with the website for the US Government Center for Disease Control and Prevention already loaded and scans the English-language page on Argentina before helpfully translating the key points for me into the language I just said that I didn't speak. \"Do you know typhoid?\" she asks. \"A little,\" I say, as if we'd met at a party once. She rattles off instructions: don't drink the water, don't open my mouth while in the shower, disinfect my hands every time I wash them, don't eat [unintelligible]. I ask her repeat it. She says a word that I do not understand. She pauses, rephrases and then, finally acknowledging my lack of fluency, switches to English. \"Don't eat salads.\" Um, ok. \"Steak?\" I ask, grinning. \"Yes. Eat steak.\" She is not smiling. She shifts back to the local language to tell me we are definitely vaccinating me against yellow fever and hepatitis A. My consent is apparently not required. Then she gives me a long lecture about rabies in Argentina, but there are too many words I don't recognize. She goes back to English with a sigh. If I get bitten by a dog or a monkey, I must go straight to the hospital. I nod to let her know that I am taking her advice seriously, while wondering how likely it is that I will be bitten by a monkey attending an Ethereum conference in Buenos Aires and also, how is it that the nurse knows the English word for \u201cmonkey\u201d but not the word for \u201cuncooked food\u201d? That's enough English, apparently. She quizzes me on my intentions. What am I doing there? Would I be with other people? Buenos Aires has a population of 16 million, so I am unlikely to be alone. But maybe this is a euphemistic phrase and she is working up to a talk on sexually transmitted diseases of Latin America. I admit yet again that I don't understand. \u201cAre you travelling alone?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d She asks me another question where I understood only two words: pleasure and risk. I blink at her in obvious confusion and she takes pity on me. \u201cDo you like risk?\u201d I bite my lip. It seems like a bad idea to admit to being a risk junkie in the Centre for Infectious Diseases. \u201cNo?\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d She thinks for a moment and comes to a decision. \u201cI think we will also give you the rabies shot.\u201d With that, she pulls out a syringe. Apparently, the time for discussion is over. --- Part Two: First Contact with Reality (KYC on a hostel bunk bed) (Edited to add links to Part Two)"
