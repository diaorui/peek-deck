**[Nexo Liquidated My Entire $123K Portfolio and they don’t want to refund!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1peorza/nexo_liquidated_my_entire_123k_portfolio_and_they/)**

I had over $123,000 on Nexo, holding NEXO tokens, Platinum status, and I was part of their Private Clients program with the portfolio boost. On October 10th, 2025, around 23:00 CET, the Nexo app completely stopped working for me. I couldn’t add USDT, swap, manage my loan, nothing. I was literally inside the app trying to fix it, and I have screen-time proof showing it was frozen. At 23:12 I suddenly got an email saying my LTV changed to 76.92%. At 23:20 I got another email telling me my collateral had been fully liquidated. When I finally managed to get back into the app at 00:26 CET, everything was gone. My entire $123K portfolio was wiped out while I was stuck watching the app glitch out. This isn’t even the first time something like this has happened. Coinfomania reported in April 2025 that Nexo had already been accused of unfair liquidations worth $10 million. People were saying the same thing back then: the app wasn’t working and they only got two emails before losing everything. Nexo is registered in the Cayman Islands and acts like it’s untouchable. They ignore EU and US courts and even ignore letters from lawyers who represent affected users. And Antoni Trenchev is nowhere to be found. When Binance had system issues, they actually compensated their users. Nexo stayed silent. They didn’t just liquidate me, they took everything while their own platform was offline. Since my situation happened, a lot of people have reached out with almost identical stories. Same timeline, same type of outage, same zero response from Nexo. At this point it’s obvious we won’t get anywhere alone. If you had a similar experience, we need to organize together and take collective action. Nexo isn’t giving anyone answers on their own. #Nexo #CryptoScam #DeFi #NexoDown #CryptoJustice

**[Here's the full tech stack including ethereum rollups deployment platform we use to run our blockchain game with 10k players](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1peu4wz/heres_the_full_tech_stack_including_ethereum/)**

saw some questions about production web3 gaming setups so figured i'd share our full stack, we run a multiplayer game with about 10k active players. frontend: unity for game client, react for web dashboard smart contracts: solidity, hardhat for development, foundry for testing infrastructure: caldera for rollup deployment, alchemy for backup rpc calls, the graph for indexing monitoring: tenderly for transaction monitoring, sentry for error tracking deployment: github actions for ci/cd, vercel for web hosting analytics: mixpanel for user analytics, dune for on chain analytics The infrastructure piece was the biggest decision, we initially tried deploying our own rollup but it was a nightmare, switched to managed solution and shipped way faster. deployment was straightforward and support has been solid when we needed it. The biggest cost is actually alchemy for backup rpc even though we have our own nodes, turns out redundancy is worth it when you have paying users. whole stack runs about $800-1000 per month. We use both hardhat and foundry because hardhat for deployment scripts and foundry for testing since its way faster. mostly standard ethereum tools, game specific stuff is all in unity not on chain. Im happy to answer questions about any of these choices or tradeoffs we made.
