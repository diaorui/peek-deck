**[Now its a proper Robot Dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wzwyc5/now_its_a_proper_robot_dog/)**

I finally chopped two legs off my hexapod robot and now its a proper robot dog. Dont worry all the features I have developed for the old robot transferred just fine to the new robot; we still have body leveling, emotes, puppet mode etc. Quttro ZBD is lighter, faster and more agile in many ways than its hexapod older sibling yet due to less parts used it costs considerably less to build, around 200 usd. Still uses ESP32 S3 as well as off the shelf Arduino parts and DS3218 servos. reduced number of legs made it a lot easier to put together and since I already ironed out the scripts for previous version and use inverse kinematics solver for each leg adjusting the gait mechanism was a breeze as well. I will also work on reinforcement training for a developing a control policy in IK solver's place, I am hoping I can get a more organic / fluid walking out of the robot instead of current mechanic looks. I shared a more detailed video about it on my youtube channel, if you want you can watch it from the link below: https://youtu.be/J99MibRi-CY It is still fully open source so you can find all the files you need to build one down in the links.

So expect a bipedal version in upcoming weeks if I can make it walk :)

**[I've built a tool that designs a whole robot from a text description: servos, electronics, 3D body, firmware, then tests it in MuJoCo](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1x01mmd/ive_built_a_tool_that_designs_a_whole_robot_from/)**

Try it: https://holocron-engine.com This is a quadruped (Mini Pupper style) designed end to end in my app. You describe the robot, and it picks real servos (Feetech STS3250 here), plans the electronics, lays out the body, builds the 3D structure and shell, writes the firmware, and runs it in MuJoCo physics before anything gets printed. It's early and plenty is still rough. I'd really like feedback from people who've actually built robots: what was the hardest part of your design, and what would make a tool like this useful (or useless) to you?

**[Current sensing lets me pet my robot properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wzv2cm/current_sensing_lets_me_pet_my_robot_properly/)**

I don't normally talk like in the video, but I can't help talking to my Mino as if it were a little dog :) Anyway, I was not able to pet it without the servos pushing back and suffering, so I integrated current sensors in the PCB and coded an algorithm on the MCU that detects an external force on the servos. When the force is too high, the servos go into "follow mode". You can see that in action around 0:12. In addition to making proper petting possible, this behavior protects the servos from overexertion. Best spent extra lines in the BOM and the code.

**[I gave my Stack-chan LEGO wheels and taught it to drive using open-source Robium robotics skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1x01aas/i_gave_my_stackchan_lego_wheels_and_taught_it_to/)**

I’ve been experimenting with turning an M5Stack Stack-chan into a little mobile robot. I combined it with a LEGO motor hub and wheels, recorded driving demonstrations, and trained an ACT policy. During supervised trials, it learned to follow a line. With a separate set of demonstrations, I also tried driving between guardrails. The video shows the build, data collection, and the wrong turns along the way 😅 Build video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1pQTt8gqZM This is also the first showcase of what I’ve built with Robium, an open-source robotics skills repo that I recently released. I used it with AI agents to help build the software and training setup. GitHub: https://github.com/robium-ai/robium Has anyone else experimented with learning from demonstrations on a small wheeled robot? I’d be interested to hear what worked for you.

**[My 2nd attempt to get a LEGO Star Wars AT-AT walking — using Quaddle robot's own servos and controller](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1x09a9l/my_2nd_attempt_to_get_a_lego_star_wars_atat/)**

Follow-up to an earlier post here: mounted LEGO Star Wars AT-AT legs (set 75440, static display model, no motor) directly onto Quaddle (open quadruped, 4 feedback servos, ESP32-S3, OpenCat firmware), controller driving them directly. Attempt #1 failed — the original leg was bent and genuinely couldn't walk. For attempt #2: swapped it for a longer, straight replacement piece, checked the servos could carry the added weight, reversed one servo from its default install direction, and mounted it all through Quaddle's screw-free servo mechanism. Walked surprisingly well once that was sorted. Also recreated the classic AT-AT-tripped-by-a-snowspeeder scene from the movie. 😂 What would you mount on an open quadruped platform if you could?

I have been thinking of starting some cool personal projects. I had a hexapod robot in my mind, like the ones in Watch Dogs: Legion game, for a long time when I was still studying but don't feel like doing it anymore. Thought of asking you guys. Hit me with your best ones ;)

**[I want to make self-replicating factories.](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wzfxpf/i_want_to_make_selfreplicating_factories/)**

Reindustrialization won't happen against economic laws. Manufacturing has to be competitive worldwide, and improving existing factories, even with automation, is not enough. Only 30-40k robots were installed in the US last year, so the pull from existing factories is weak. They’re good. Humanoids are being promised as the solution, but who will build them? Still humans. Humanoids not optimised for self-build. The most practical solution to these problems is a self-replicating factory. It will build humanoids, enable the US reindustrialization, and help colonise other planets as a side product. Similar to biological organisms, the factory can consist of robotic cells, and an AI agent coordinates them to produce a new cell and deploy it. The cell can be specialised with fixtures for specific tasks such as assembling, calibration, testing, 3D printing, etc. Sounds like sci-fi, but recent releases of Astra/Opus have made this possible. Who wants to join?

**[Multiplexing in Robotics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1x0e5q2/multiplexing_in_robotics/)**

Recently I’ve been looking into diy’ing a 4// 6dgof cobot for my electronics workstation. It seems like 100% of the time you’ll find a 1:1 motor to dgof relationship for building joints. might be a dumb question, but why isn’t multiplexing a more common practice? how big of a loss is backdrive functionality?

Advances in AI offer tantalizing glimpses of a future in which robots navigate the world the way humans do. The question is whether the same techniques that fueled AI’s recent progress will be enough to get there, or if an entirely new path is required.
