**[“Change Management” doesn’t work on AI adoption.](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pexa5f/change_management_doesnt_work_on_ai_adoption/)**

“It failed because we didn’t invest in change management”. This is one I hear a lot from people across the industry. They’re kindof right. Take a minute and think about why IT and data teams leave “change management” out of their projects… A: They always want to include “resisters” for “feedback” - who just create timeline / budget chaos and lots of “no”. There’s no instruction manual on AI so there’s no point. These people aren’t going to adopt early anyway and kick up anxiety for the project team. So leave them out and kick your change people to the curb if they insist upon “bringing everyone along”. This following routinely drives 60% - 90% adoption rates companies. Instead - segment your users into 3 groups: Super early adopters (5% of employees) Learner translators (15% of employees) Reluctants (70%-80%) (Kindof like crossing the chasm groups) The first one gives you high value use cases and 100% participation on pilots (not 10%-20% participation on pilots). Be RUTHLESS about your pilots. If people aren’t participating - kick. them. OUT. and redistribute the licenses. The second group learns from the early adopters, will help you validate what’s useful, and will TEACH everyone else. Keep the use cases simple and high value for the reluctants. Dont throw too much at them. Make it PRESCRIPTIVE (process map, prompts, checklists). Make sure your leaders visibly point to the good work early adopters are doing. This is key - you want FOMO. Triggering the need to fit in is FAR more powerful and productive than bringing people along with each step. As people keep using tools - lean into automation to drive last mile adoption among leaders and laggards.

**[How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46145180)**

In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.

Multiple divisions at Microsoft have lowered sales growth targets for certain artificial intelligence products after many ​sales staff missed goals in the fiscal year that ‌ended in June, The Information reported on Wednesday.  It is rare for Microsoft to ‌lower quotas for specific products, the report said, citing two salespeople in the Azure cloud unit.  Lower sales growth goals for Microsoft's AI products are likely to fans fears about ​real-world adoption of AI as an MIT study from earlier ‌this year had found that only about 5% of AI projects advance beyond the pilot stage.
