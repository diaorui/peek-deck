**[Just used Gemini for a solo DND session…](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pfscbo/just_used_gemini_for_a_solo_dnd_session/)**

… and man it could not have gone worse. It started out alright and seemed to be tracking things well, until it gave me some confusing information about the layout of a room and after that everything devolved into random chaos. As it stands, I’d say it could work well if you have no short term memory. Otherwise, the technology is just not there yet. And that’s sad because finding time and people to play DND with is a challenge all on its own.

**[Looking back on the practical use of AI in 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pfr9jp/looking_back_on_the_practical_use_of_ai_in_2025/)**

Hey all, amidst all the downsides of AI this past year - be it environmental worries, slop in music and art, AI enshittification, GPU/RAM prices increasing - I wanted to discuss about what's how WE are using AI, among a general look at changes on a larger scale. Personally, it feels like I haven't really felt a huge difference within the stuff I use which is just the basic stuff like GPT / Gemini. However, one change for me was that I've been using it for language learning which I've felt has been quite useful. On a general level, I feel like I've been seeing some practical applications that improved considerably this year compared to last years. An example I've seen recently is in health, where AI imaging can catch breast cancer way earlier and with higher accuracy. Another is in programming, where it feels like there's a huge rise in "Vibes Coding" with even sites like Bolt/v0. Now I'm not gonna pretend like I know how any of these work, but I do think it's interesting how there's a practical use for AI in these fields now. What about for you guys? Has AI gotten better or worse this year, and where did you actually feel the difference?

**[How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46145180)**

In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.
