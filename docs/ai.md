Hey everyone, here is the 10th issue of Hacker News x AI newsletter, a newsletter I started 10 weeks ago as an experiment to see if there is an audience for such content. This is a weekly AI related links from Hacker News and the discussions around them. AI CEO demo that lets an LLM act as your boss, triggering debate about automating management, labor, and whether agents will replace workers or executives first. Link to HN Tooling to spin up always-on AI agents that coordinate as a simulated organization, with questions about emergent behavior, reliability, and where human oversight still matters. Link to HN Thread on AI-driven automation of work, from “agents doing 90% of your job” to macro fears about AGI, unemployment, population collapse, and calls for global governance of GPU farms and AGI research. Link to HN Debate over AI replacing CEOs and other “soft” roles, how capital might adopt AI-CEO-as-a-service, and the ethical/economic implications of AI owners, governance, and capitalism with machine leadership.

**[How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46145180)**

In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.
