**['Godfather of AI' Geoffrey Hinton says Google is 'beginning to overtake' OpenAI: 'My guess is Google will win'](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pf0p2w/godfather_of_ai_geoffrey_hinton_says_google_is/)**

Geoffrey Hinton, an AI pioneer who previously worked at Google Brain, said it was "surprising than it's taken this long" for Google to catch OpenAI.

**[Using AI as a "blandness detector" instead of a content generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pf6ca7/using_ai_as_a_blandness_detector_instead_of_a/)**

Most discourse around AI writing is about using it to generate content faster. I've been experimenting with the opposite: using AI to identify when my content is too generic. The test is simple. Paste your core argument into ChatGPT with: "Does this sound like a reasonable, balanced take?" If AI enthusiastically agrees → you've written something probable. Consensus. Average. If AI hedges or pushes back → you've found an edge. Something that doesn't match the 10,000 similar takes in its training data. The logic: AI outputs probability. It's trained on the aggregate of human writing. So enthusiastic agreement means your idea is statistically common. And statistically common = forgettable. I've started using AI exclusively as adversarial QA on my drafts: Act as a cynical, skeptical critic. Tear this apart: 🧉 Where am I being too generic? 🧉 Where am I hiding behind vague language? 🧉 What am I afraid to say directly? Write the draft yourself. Let AI attack it. Revise based on the critique. The draft stays human. The critique is AI. The revision is human again. Curious if anyone else is using AI this way—as a detector rather than generator.

**[This tech is just wild](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pf123f/this_tech_is_just_wild/)**

I found a show in Swedish and went down the rabbit hole to see if I could translate it into English. Just dubbing in English would remove the other sounds in the video, such as music and ambient noise, so I just wanted to remove or reduce the Swedish and insert the English, leaving the rest. I used ChatGPT to guide me through the process. I used Faster Whisper XXL to do the translation/subtitle creation. I loaded the subtitles into Balabolka and used copious amounts of Google Fu to figure out how to add the more "natural" speaking models and settled on using Guy to generate the new speaking track. Then I used Ultimate Vocal Remover to separate the non-speaking audio into an "instrumental" file and used ffmpeg to add both the "Guy" and "instrumental" audio into the video. It was a fun experiment to scratch that nerd itch but it did get a bit fatiguing to listen to the same voice for each person, so I'll probably just be happy with English subtitles next time around. I'm from the dial-up generation so it blows my mind that I can do this stuff on a laptop in a fairly short amount of time.

**[Are real-time rewards and punishments via social media the next logical step?](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pf9z4g/are_realtime_rewards_and_punishments_via_social/)**

Obviously algorithms and bots already massively twist people's perceptions of each other on social media. They boost controversial posts and ones that shift your focus quickly, as well as propaganda that the company owning the platform wants you to see. And of course they tend to boost trolling and infighting in groups they don't like, especially leftist and anti-capitalist ones. Old news. But as AI gets better at both processing social media content and generating fake content, I wonder if it will be used for more direct mental manipulation. Like if you interact positively with a post the algorithm "likes", it won't only show you more like it, it will show you something you like to give you a little dopamine or make you feel more at home with the accounts you're following, and if you engage with something it doesn't like it will do the opposite. Eventually it could do the same in response to things you do in real life, using location data, security cameras etc. Basically the same way someone emotionally abusive tries to manipulate you, or the way nazis and other fascist groups target lonely people and accept them only if they go along with their beliefs, I'm thinking tech companies could possibly do that on a larger scale. Is this possible / coming soon / already happening? I'm interested to hear your opinions. And is there any information out there on this? I could have sworn I saw an article headline predicting something about it a few years ago but I never read it and now I can't find it

**[How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46145180)**

In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.

Multiple divisions at Microsoft have lowered sales growth targets for certain artificial intelligence products after many ​sales staff missed goals in the fiscal year that ‌ended in June, The Information reported on Wednesday.  It is rare for Microsoft to ‌lower quotas for specific products, the report said, citing two salespeople in the Azure cloud unit.  Lower sales growth goals for Microsoft's AI products are likely to fans fears about ​real-world adoption of AI as an MIT study from earlier ‌this year had found that only about 5% of AI projects advance beyond the pilot stage.
