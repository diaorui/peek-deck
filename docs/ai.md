Our RAG stack degraded slowly over months. Text-shape differences created different embedding vectors Hidden characters slipped in from OCR Partial updates mixed old and new embeddings Incremental index rebuilds drifted from ground truth Retrieval looked random at times, but the retriever wasn’t the problem. We enforced a consistent embedding pipeline: Canonical preprocessing that never changes silently Full re-embeddings instead of patching Version-pinned embedding model Stable index rebuild rules tied to segmentation changes Impact: Retrieval reliability improved immediately Embedding clusters became predictable Fewer “mysterious RAG failures” Debug time dropped dramatically Have you seen embedding drift show up in long-running systems?

**[How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46145180)**

In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.
