**[I Use Value Averaging Instead of DCA - Here’s Why It Works Better](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pfovap/i_use_value_averaging_instead_of_dca_heres_why_it/)**

You see a lot of “just DCA bro” advice on here.Nothing wrong with DCA it’s simple and beginner-friendly but I moved to Value Averaging this cycle, and the results have been way better. Most people know DCA because it’s simple: buy the same amount every week.But when you’re trying to get better prices and make the market’s volatility work for you, Value Averaging is a much stronger method. Let me show you exactly how it played out using real BTC price action from 2024–2025. Rule I Followed Every 15% drop in BTC : Buy. First Buy = $1,000 Second Buy = $2,000 Third Buy = 3000$ Continues..... BTC gave three clean 30% corrections this cycle, so this rule activated six times. Drawdown 1 — March 2024 (-30%) BTC dropped twice by 15%, so we can bought: $1,000 ( Buy 01 ) $2,000 ( Buy 02 ) Later, when BTC reached what I marked as “Top 3,” these were the gains: $1,000 → +95% = +$950 $2,000 → +131% = +$2,620 Total = $3,570 profit Drawdown 2 — December 2024 (-30%) Same plan again: $1,000 ( Buy 03 ) $2000 ( Buy 04 ) During the recovery toward Top 3, three positions were still showing: +$950 ( Buy 01 ) +$2620 ( Buy 02 ) +$330 ( Buy 03 ) +$1140 ( Buy 04 ) Total = $5,040 profit Current Drawdown — 2025 July–Oct (-30%) This is where we are right now. Two more buys triggered: Buy 05: $1,000 → currently –14% Buy 06: $2,000 → currently breakeven These are fresh buys, so it’s totally normal that they haven’t recovered yet. Total Structure 6 total buys – 3 × $1,000 – 3 × $2,000 Total invested = $9,000 Right now, even though BTC is still in a ~30% decline: Three positions remain in profit ($420 + $1,300 + $260) One is slightly negative (–$140) Two are at breakeven Overall: still profitable during a drawdown. Why This Beats DCA for Me DCA buys at every price expensive, cheap, doesn’t matter. Value Averaging waits for discounts. You buy more when BTC is cheaper Your average cost drops fast Strong assets recover and reward the early buys Drawdowns become opportunities instead of pain Your risk is distributed intelligently no guessing bottoms. no chasing tops.Just reacting to 15% dips the same way, every time. This is the whole point:

**[Are you concerned about Bitcoin's 4-year cycle?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pf7oou/are_you_concerned_about_bitcoins_4year_cycle/)**

I have never purchased any cryptocurrency; I am more of a stock market person, just wanted to ask the community what your thoughts are on this theory, given that it is a highly speculative asset. The thing is, the other day I did some analysis and, looking at the second image, during the 12 months leading up to the midterms, there is usually a drawdown in the S&P 500, followed by a recovery. Edit: the table was published by Longview Economics on November 28, 2025. In 2026, it seems that both things will coincide (the run-up to the midterms and the $BTC 4-year cycle theory), hence my curiosity.
