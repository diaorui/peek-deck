**[Weak hands and overleveraged tourists panic-sell every dip. Try HODLing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pf5aef/weak_hands_and_overleveraged_tourists_panicsell/)**

Charts like this always remind me why time in the market beats timing the market. Short-term traders panic on every red candle, but the data is brutally simple: the longer you hold Bitcoin, the lower your chances of losing money, dropping to basically 0% after 3+ years. Most of the fear comes from weak hands and over-leveraged gamblers who treat volatility like a threat instead of a feature. Meanwhile, patient holders just keep stacking and waiting. I watched this morning a Bitget live streamer bought 2 $BTC and i think this will be a gold in the next halving... Bitcoin rewards conviction, not panic.

**[Are you concerned about Bitcoin's 4-year cycle?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pf7oou/are_you_concerned_about_bitcoins_4year_cycle/)**

I have never purchased any cryptocurrency; I am more of a stock market person, just wanted to ask the community what your thoughts are on this theory, given that it is a highly speculative asset. The thing is, the other day I did some analysis and, looking at the second image, during the 12 months leading up to the midterms, there is usually a drawdown in the S&P 500, followed by a recovery. Edit: the table was published by Longview Economics on November 28, 2025. In 2026, it seems that both things will coincide (the run-up to the midterms and the $BTC 4-year cycle theory), hence my curiosity.

**[Did you know you can generate a Bitcoin private key using a coin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pf234m/did_you_know_you_can_generate_a_bitcoin_private/)**

Most people let their wallet software generate their private key, which is totally fine but Bitcoin doesn’t require a computer to create one. A Bitcoin private key is just a 256-bit number… And a fair coin flip produces 1 bit of entropy. So in theory (and in practice), you can generate a completely valid, secure Bitcoin private key by doing: Heads = 1 Tails = 0 The math is simple. 256 coin flips is 2^256 potential outcomes. Once you have your 256-bit binary sequence, you can convert it offline into: hex format WIF private key or even a BIP39 seed phrase All without touching the internet. You could also do this with dice, a dice roll is roughly 2.585 bits of entropy. Therefore 99-100 dice rolls will give you enough entropy for a 256 bit private key. This works because Bitcoin’s security comes from math. I mean how could you not love Bitcoin!
