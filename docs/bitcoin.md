**[BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Sheds $2.7 Billion in Record Outflows Run](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-sheds-2-081140067.html)**

Investors yanked more than $2.7 billion from the exchange-traded fund over the five weeks to Nov. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The IBIT fund oversees more than $71 billion in assets and has served as the flagship vehicle for traditional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin.  The sustained period of outflows aligns with Bitcoin’s slide into a bear market following a severe liquidation event in early October, which kicked off a more than $1 trillion wipeout in crypto market value.
