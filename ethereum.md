**[Nexo Liquidated My Entire $123K Portfolio and they don’t want to refund!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1peorza/nexo_liquidated_my_entire_123k_portfolio_and_they/)**

I had over $123,000 on Nexo, holding NEXO tokens, Platinum status, and I was part of their Private Clients program with the portfolio boost. On October 10th, 2025, around 23:00 CET, the Nexo app completely stopped working for me. I couldn’t add USDT, swap, manage my loan, nothing. I was literally inside the app trying to fix it, and I have screen-time proof showing it was frozen. At 23:12 I suddenly got an email saying my LTV changed to 76.92%. At 23:20 I got another email telling me my collateral had been fully liquidated. When I finally managed to get back into the app at 00:26 CET, everything was gone. My entire $123K portfolio was wiped out while I was stuck watching the app glitch out. This isn’t even the first time something like this has happened. Coinfomania reported in April 2025 that Nexo had already been accused of unfair liquidations worth $10 million. People were saying the same thing back then: the app wasn’t working and they only got two emails before losing everything. Nexo is registered in the Cayman Islands and acts like it’s untouchable. They ignore EU and US courts and even ignore letters from lawyers who represent affected users. And Antoni Trenchev is nowhere to be found. When Binance had system issues, they actually compensated their users. Nexo stayed silent. They didn’t just liquidate me, they took everything while their own platform was offline. Since my situation happened, a lot of people have reached out with almost identical stories. Same timeline, same type of outage, same zero response from Nexo. At this point it’s obvious we won’t get anywhere alone. If you had a similar experience, we need to organize together and take collective action. Nexo isn’t giving anyone answers on their own. #Nexo #CryptoScam #DeFi #NexoDown #CryptoJustice

**[How is Ethereum solving the blockchain trilemma? Post Fusaka upgrade analysis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1pdra4c/how_is_ethereum_solving_the_blockchain_trilemma/)**

Ethereum is actively working to address the blockchain trilemma, a core challenge in the design of decentralized systems that suggests a blockchain can only achieve two of three key properties—Decentralization, Security, and Scalability—at the same time. Ethereum's strategy involves a multi-phased roadmap and the heavy utilization of Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions to tackle scalability while maintaining its core commitments to decentralization and security. 🛡️ Security and Decentralization Ethereum's foundational layer, or Layer 1 (L1), prioritizes security and decentralization, which are fundamental to its value proposition as a "world computer." Security: The network transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), known as The Merge (September 2022). PoS maintains a high level of security by making it prohibitively expensive for a malicious actor to gain enough staked ETH to compromise the network. The economic cost of an attack on Ethereum's PoS network is arguably higher than on its former PoW network. Decentralization: PoS is intended to boost decentralization in the long run by making it easier for more people to become validators, as it requires less specialized, expensive hardware compared to PoW mining. The development roadmap also includes phases like The Scourge and The Purge, which aim to further improve censorship resistance and reduce the hardware requirements for running a node, promoting wider network participation. 🚀 Scaling (Solving the Trilemma's Third Side) Ethereum's main challenge was scalability—the network became congested, leading to slow transactions and high gas fees. The strategy to address this is primarily through Layer 2 solutions and fundamental L1 upgrades. Layer 2 (L2) Scaling Solutions Ethereum leans heavily on L2 networks, which process transactions off the main chain but settle on L1, inheriting Ethereum's robust security. Rollups: These are the most prominent L2 solution. They execute thousands of transactions off-chain and then bundle ("roll up") the resulting data into a single, compressed transaction that gets submitted back to the Ethereum Mainnet. Optimistic Rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism): Assume transactions are valid but allow a "challenge period" where anyone can submit a fraud proof if they detect an invalid transaction. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups (e.g., zkSync, Starknet): Use cryptographic proofs (validity proofs) to instantly verify the correctness of off-chain transactions, providing stronger security guarantees. By offloading the execution layer to L2s, Ethereum L1 can focus on its role as the secure and decentralized data availability layer. Layer 1 Upgrades Ethereum's roadmap includes major L1 upgrades to support the L2 scaling strategy: Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844): Implemented in the Dencun upgrade (March 2024), this introduced a new, cheaper way for rollups to post transaction data to the L1 using "blobs". This significantly lowered L2 transaction costs, boosting scalability without compromising security or decentralization. The Surge (Full Sharding): The long-term vision involves a form of data sharding where the network is split to handle data more efficiently. This will dramatically increase the data capacity of the L1, further scaling the L2 ecosystem to potentially handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second (TPS). In essence, Ethereum is solving the trilemma by adopting a layered approach: L1 provides decentralized security, and L2s provide scalability.
