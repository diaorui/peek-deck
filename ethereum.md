**[My master's thesis project - A web3 video streaming app](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1sohdzd/my_masters_thesis_project_a_web3_video_streaming/)**

Hey all. I just wrapped my master's thesis and figured this sub would actually care about the technical side instead of the price-talk side, so here goes. The thing that always bugged me about existing web3 video platforms is that each one only solves one slice of the problem. Livepeer does transcoding. Theta does P2P relay. Odysee does storage + discovery. PeerTube does federation. None of them stitch identity + gating + payouts + delivery + governance into a single app you can actually use end to end. So I tried to build that, and then benchmark it honestly to see where the real walls are. Stack ended up being: SIWE (EIP-4361) for auth, no email/password anywhere. Wallet address is the user ID across every microservice. ERC-1155 for tiered content gating (Viewer / Supporter / VIP). VIP holders also get priority + a reward multiplier in the P2P layer. 0xSplits + a thin StreamRevenue contract for per-stream revenue distribution. Anyone can trigger the payout, the platform can't withhold. StreamToken (ERC-20 + Votes) for tipping, P2P rewards, and DAO voting. OZ Governor + Timelock controlling a ModerationRegistry contract, so bans actually go through a vote instead of a mod's mood. A custom P2P tracker (Node + WebSocket) that matches viewers by Haversine distance and rewards relays based on bytes × quality multiplier × uptime bonus, instead of the flat-rate model Theta uses. IPFS via Pinata for VOD persistence, with graceful fallback to local if pinning is down. The base streaming pipeline is boring on purpose: NGINX-RTMP ingest, FFmpeg multi-bitrate HLS (1080/720/480/360), Shaka Player on the client. Everything talks to chain through a single Web3 service (ethers.js) so the Go and Python services don't each need to know about Solidity. Target deploy is Arbitrum, dev is on a local Hardhat node. Numbers from the benchmarks (single-machine docker, M4 Pro, 2 CPU / 8 GB allocated to docker so this is conservative): NFT gate verification: P95 = 43 ms (target was <100 ms). 60s Redis cache on top. Revenue API under 50 VUs: P95 = 97 ms, 0% errors at ~78 req/s. P2P browser benchmark with 20 real headless Chromium peers: 92.6% bandwidth savings, 92% hit rate, sub-linear origin growth as peers double. Gas on Arbitrum: NFT mint ~0.024 dollars, tip ~0.018 dollars, full governance lifecycle (propose+vote+queue+execute) ~0.17 dollars. On L1 the same stuff is 100-500x more, which kills the whole thing economically. L2 isn't optional. Stuff that didn't work / I want to be honest about: I tried WHIP (WebRTC ingest) for like 3 weeks. Three different approaches with Pion + FFmpeg, all of them either gave me color corruption from RTP header extensions or frozen frames from clock mismatch. Eventually realized it was pointless: HLS segment buffering (6-12s) dominates end-to-end latency, so saving 80ms on ingest does nothing for the viewer. Killed it and went back to RTMP. Calling that out as a negative result in the thesis felt better than pretending it worked. The P2P layer right now uses a WebSocket relay through the tracker as fallback when WebRTC datachannels can't be established. Adds a hop. Direct WebRTC + proper STUN/TURN is on the future-work list. All benchmarks are single-machine. So peers share the same loopback, which obviously inflates the hit rates a bit. Real geo-distributed numbers would be worse, but the relative comparison still holds. 24h batching of P2P rewards instead of per-segment, because per-segment micropayments at 0.018 dollars a pop aren't economical even on L2. Per-stream channels (state channels / payment streams) could fix this but I didn't get there. What I'd actually love feedback on from this sub: The quality-aware reward formula (bytes × resolution multiplier × uptime). Is this gameable in obvious ways I'm missing? A peer can fake reporting bytes served, but the requesting peer also reports received bytes, so there's a cross-check. Still feels weak. Anyone running production P2P video at scale who can sanity-check the 88-93% savings number? My gut says it's optimistic for real cross-NAT conditions. Is governance-controlled moderation a complete dead end for anything bigger than a small DAO? Voting periods of "5 minutes to 24 hours" are useless for actual abuse response and I don't have a great answer for that.
