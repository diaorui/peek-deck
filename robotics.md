**[The world's first 'biomimetic AI robot' just strolled in from the uncanny valley - and yes, it's super-creepy](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1r0zrzk/the_worlds_first_biomimetic_ai_robot_just/)**

A Shanghai startup, DroidUp, has unveiled Moya, a biomimetic AI robot designed to cross the uncanny valley. Unlike plastic and metal droids, Moya features silicone skin that is heated to human body temperature and mimics subtle facial expressions like eyebrow raises. Standing 5'5" and weighing 70 lbs, Moya is built on a modular platform that allows for swapping between male and female presentations. With a price tag of ~$173k, DroidUp aims to deploy these warm companions in healthcare and business by late 2026.

**[We trained a VLA model on 20,000 hours of real robot data across 9 embodiments, then tested it on 100 tasks. Here's what actually worked and what didn't.](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1r0au80/we_trained_a_vla_model_on_20000_hours_of_real/)**

Over the past year our team built LingBot-VLA, a Vision-Language-Action foundation model for dual-arm manipulation. We just released everything: code, base model, and benchmark data (paper: arXiv:2601.18692, code: github.com/robbyant/lingbot-vla, weights on HuggingFace). I wanted to share what we learned deploying this across real hardware because the results tell an honest and, I think, useful story for anyone working on generalist robot policies. The setup: ~20,000 hours of teleoperated manipulation data from 9 mainstream dual-arm configs (Agibot G1, AgileX, Galaxea R1Pro, Realman, Leju KUAVO, and others). We evaluated on 3 physical platforms, 100 tasks each, 130 post-training demos per task, 15 trials per task per model. That's 22,500 total real-world trials comparing us against π0.5, GR00T N1.6, and WALL-OSS under identical conditions. The honest numbers: our best variant (with depth distillation) hit 17.30% average success rate and 35.41% progress score across all 300 task-platform pairs. π0.5 got 13.02% SR / 27.65% PS. WALL-OSS landed at 4.05% SR. Before anyone says "17% is low," I want to contextualize this. These are 100 diverse bimanual tasks, many requiring multi-step fine-grained manipulation (cleaning tableware, stacking, arranging objects), tested across three physically different robots. Some individual tasks hit 80%+ SR, others are near zero. Real-world bimanual manipulation across this breadth of tasks is genuinely hard, and I think the field benefits from reporting these numbers honestly rather than cherry-picking the best 5 tasks for a demo reel. What actually worked well: Scaling laws are real and not saturating. We ran a systematic study scaling pre-training data from 3K to 6K to 13K to 18K to 20K hours. Success rates climbed consistently across all three platforms with no sign of plateau at 20K. This was the most exciting finding for us because it suggests the path forward is clear: more diverse, high-quality real-world data keeps helping. Depth distillation made a meaningful difference. We use learnable queries aligned with depth embeddings from our LingBot-Depth model via cross-attention. This bumped average SR from 15.74% to 17.30% in real-world and from 85.34% to 86.68% in randomized simulation scenes. The gain was most visible on transparent object manipulation (glass vases, clear containers) where RGB alone struggles. Data-efficient adaptation. With only 80 demos per task, LingBot-VLA outperformed π0.5 trained on the full 130 demos, in both SR and progress score. The gap widened as we added more post-training data, which suggests the pre-training is providing genuinely useful priors rather than just memorizing. Training efficiency. We built a custom codebase with FSDP2, mixed-precision, FlexAttention, and operator fusion via torch.compile. On 8 GPUs we get 261 samples/sec/GPU for the Qwen2.5-VL-3B backbone, which is 1.5x to 2.8x faster than StarVLA, Dexbotic, and OpenPI depending on the VLM. Scaling to 256 GPUs tracks near-linear throughput. This matters practically because iterating on 20K hours of data is brutal without an efficient pipeline. What didn't work or remains unsolved: Plenty of tasks are still near 0% SR across all models. Tasks requiring very precise spatial reasoning in cluttered scenes, long-horizon multi-step sequences, or unusual object geometries remain extremely challenging. The depth distillation helps but doesn't solve spatial reasoning completely. Also, the model currently only covers dual-arm tabletop manipulation. Single-arm, mobile manipulation, and non-tabletop scenarios are future work. The architecture uses a Mixture-of-Transformers design (similar to BAGEL) where the VLM and action expert share self-attention but have separate feedforward pathways. Action generation uses flow matching with 50-step action chunks. We found the shared attention critical for letting semantic understanding guide action prediction without the modalities interfering with each other's representations. One thing I'd love to hear from this community: for those of you working with real dual-arm setups, what task categories do you find most important for practical deployment? Our GM-100 benchmark covers 100 tasks but we're always thinking about what's missing. Also curious if anyone has experimented with alternative spatial representations beyond depth for VLA models. All code, model weights, and the benchmark data are public. We wanted to make sure anyone can reproduce these results and build on them.

**[Building a robot](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1r0len2/building_a_robot/)**

Hi guys! Im 17 and Have NO prior experience to ths. As you can see in the caption, i wanna build a robot. Its Supposed to be a Mining robot, one they could perhaps use instead of Human workers in very Dangerous Enviroments (Deadly Gasses in the Mine or Radioactive material or similar stuff.) Im Currently still drawing the blueprint. Its more jst a suggestion currently but anyways. (I will attach a picture of the current status, most of it will probably Change, also sorry if the handwriting is bad). So. My rough ideas: it will use something like tank tracks to move around (in drawing too). Because its easier to maintain than legs, cheaper and less complicated. Im still somewhat stuck on the arms, where they meet the upper hull i will probably use an electric servo motor so its more detailed, the arms themselves will probably use hydraulics because they are POWAH (as far as i know). Which in this case is very much needed. At the peak of the arm (where normally hands are) i wanna make a motor slot, so you can easily take out motors and/or change them according to tbe tool (Drill or Hammer for example). Im thinking of maybe screwing it in or using a few screws to hold it in, for easy maintenance. I have not yet though about how its gonna see around (head) or what its upper body would look like yet. As for energy supply?..probably changeable batteries (big ones) so you dont have to charge it, and can more or less let it continously work. Would you guys have any idea what could be changed on the CURRENT design?

**[Esp32 wiring help](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1r0zbrd/esp32_wiring_help/)**

Hi everyone! 👋 I’m working on a school robotics project and I could really use some help from people who are more experienced than me. I already burned one ESP32 during testing (power issues 😭), and honestly I’m now a bit scared of wiring the second one wrong and damaging it too. I understand the logic and the code part much better than the power side, so I’m looking for someone who can help by designing the full wiring in a safe way for free. Here are all the components I’m using: • ESP32 (38 pins) • L298N motor driver • 2 DC motors • QTR-8RC line sensor • 8×32 LED matrix (uses 5 pins) • servo motor mg90s • 4 × 3.7V Li-ion batteries • DC-DC buck converter • Buzzer • Breadboards + jumper wires If anybody is willing to help i would be very grateful.
