**[3-month update, in a little story about my 3D-printed robot lamp](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vvci99/3month_update_in_a_little_story_about_my/)**

A little update after about three months of working on this project. One of the more visible changes is the hardware itself. I redesigned the lamp and made a fully 3D-printed enclosure for it, so it finally looks a lot closer to what I originally had in mind rather than a prototype with exposed hardware. Probably the biggest change, though, has been the animation. I've spent a lot of time trying to make the lamp move more like an animatronic character rather than just a robot executing trajectories. At this point the mechanics aren't really the main limitation anymore. I can animate pretty much all of its movements in Watti Studio, my animation editor, so now the limiting factor is mostly how well I can actually animate it :) I moved the whole system to ROS 2 and added computer vision. The lamp streams RGB and depth from its camera, and the current point cloud can be displayed directly in the 3D view in Watti Studio. It makes it possible to see the lamp together with its surroundings while creating animations. I added lighting to the animation editor too, so the lamp's light can be keyframed together with its movements. I also spent quite a bit of time on things that aren't as fun to show in videos, especially safety. The software monitors the real movement while an animation is playing. If a joint deviates too far from the expected trajectory or something else goes wrong, the animation stops and the motors hold their current positions. The lamp also has its own REST API, so its functions can be controlled externally without being tied to the animation editor. Next I want to focus mostly on autonomous behavior and interaction with people and the environment. I'm also experimenting with reinforcement learning to teach it to jump, with the longer-term goal of getting it to actually move around on its own. There's still a lot to do, but after three months it finally feels like I have most of the basic pieces in place. I thought about making another technical demo to show the progress, but that sounded a bit boring, so I made a little story with the lamp instead :) For anyone interested in the technical side, I have a pre-release repo with more details about the hardware, software architecture and current progress: https://github.com/Nikolay-Tyulkin/Watti

Already faster than the human world record! Insane. Last year every robot was still being remote controlled. The way both robots collided with the padding at the end was quite funny

**[How much math do I actually need for robotics, and where do I start?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vviyzz/how_much_math_do_i_actually_need_for_robotics_and/)**

I’m a software engineer with 8 years of experience, mostly JavaScript. I’ve also done a fair bit of hardware on the side, drones a few years back and more recently designing my own PCBs with KiCad and ESP32. Now I want to get into robotics properly. Not buying a kit and following the instructions, I want to design and build my own thing from scratch, on a small budget. Two things I’m stuck on: 1.How much math do I really need? Math is my weak spot. I keep seeing linear algebra, calculus, control theory, kinematics mentioned and I can’t tell what’s actually required day to day vs what’s nice to have. Can I learn it as I hit each problem, or do I need to sit down and study first? 2.What’s a sensible first project? Something that teaches real fundamentals but isn’t so big I burn out halfway. Also curious how much of this changes if I want to get into reinforcement learning for control later. I’ve done Andrew Ng’s ML course and a small OpenAI Gym project, that’s about it. Any advice appreciated, especially from people who came from software.

**[Follow-up: VSArena now has a proper VLA track (camera + language, no privileged state) — repo and docs are public](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vvm3x7/followup_vsarena_now_has_a_proper_vla_track/)**

Posted about this project a little while ago — quick update since a few things changed that address feedback from that thread. Biggest change: split the observation space properly. There's now a VLA track where the policy only gets a 128x128 RGB camera + a language stacking instruction — cube poses are never sent to the policy. Scoring still uses real poses internally to grade spatial accuracy and completion, but that's judge-only, not policy-visible. State-based (privileged poses) is kept as a separate debug track and doesn't write public ELO either — wanted the "VLA vs state" distinction to be explicit rather than something people had to dig for. On the client-side physics concern from before:Studio (the in-browser demo) is spectator/dev-only, clearly labeled, and does not post to the public leaderboard. Public ELO only comes from a hosted harness that scores server-side. That harness isn't live yet —it's the one piece standing between this and actually being open for submissions. Repo + docs are public now:https://github.com/NovaCoding-G/VSArena -docs/harness.md — scoring writeup (spatial accuracy + task completion) -docs/sdk.md — submission protocol -Studio itself:https://vsarena.vercel.app/simulation (client-side, Rapier/WASM, 60fps) Still solo, still early, still not oversell-ready — but wanted to share since the VLA/state separation was directly a response to feedback here. Open to more of that, especially on what the scoring protocol might be missing.

**[For engineers deploying ML models on edge devices/robots: what’s the part that sucks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vuro24/for_engineers_deploying_ml_models_on_edge/)**

What’s the most painful part of getting an ML model from “works on my machine” → reliably running in production? I’m a student researching the practical challenges of deploying and maintaining AI models on physical devices such as robots, cameras, drones, etc. I’d be grateful it you could give me any inputs.
