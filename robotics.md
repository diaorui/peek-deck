**[Portable offline llm robot I made last night. This is obviously her naked prototype body so be nice to her](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1qsexfy/portable_offline_llm_robot_i_made_last_night_this/)**

The real meat and potatoes: I made this as a modular brain for my other robots I built recently. Right now I’m building her a tiny combat robot body so I can’t wait to program her fight moves. Already slightly tested it but just to get her to stand in a T pose then relax all motors after 5 seconds to get an idea of how to map her body. That was when I used a pi zero tho so more work is definitely needed. After that I need to completely redesign her casing. It’s literally made from an outer frame I printed in a rush and a piece of plastic that held her oled screen in the packaging.

**[Making a heavy DC motor platform safe: contactors, E-stop, and runaway prevention](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1qs7huf/making_a_heavy_dc_motor_platform_safe_contactors/)**

Hi, I’m working on a repurposed electric wheelchair chassis (>100 kg, high-torque DC motors). Current test setup (yes, I know it’s not safe): • 2 DC motors • Sabertooth 2x32 • 24 V battery pack (2×12 V AGM) • Batteries connected directly to the Sabertooth • Motors connected directly to the Sabertooth • Control is classic RC (throttle + steering) • Motors have normally-closed electromagnetic brakes, but they are not wired yet (mechanically released) Right now: • As soon as I connect the batteries, the controller is powered • There is no real kill switch • The only way to stop everything is unplugging battery connectors • If something goes wrong, the platform could move uncontrollably I’m fully aware this is not acceptable, which is why I’m posting. My goal is to make this safe in as many realistic failure scenarios as possible: • If the main battery disconnects on a slope, the system should default to a safe state (this is where normally-closed electromagnetic brakes make sense). • If RC glitches, is lost, or a microcontroller crashes, the platform must not run away. • Whatever fails (RC, MCU, software, power), there should always be a solid hardware-level barrier preventing uncontrolled motion. I’m planning a hardware upgrade soon: • proper E-STOP / kill switch • DC contactors • wiring the electromagnetic brakes • and adding some kind of MCU in the control chain (ESP32 is the obvious option for me, but Raspberry Pi / onboard computer is also possible) The Sabertooth will remain only the motor power controller. The open question for me is the architecture: whether it’s better to keep “safety/control” and “robotics/autonomy” separated (for example one small MCU for safety + another board for higher-level stuff), or if people commonly keep everything on one controller. What I’m looking for is very practical advice: • How to design a solid anti-runaway architecture for this kind of platform • Where to physically cut power to make the system safe (battery side vs motor lines) • What type of DC contactors is typically used for high-torque DC motors (ratings, poles, inductive loads) • How normally-closed electromagnetic brakes are usually wired in a fail-safe way • How people typically split responsibilities between hardware safety, motor controller config, and a microcontroller (one vs two controllers, etc.) I’m not chasing theory or certifications. I want proven, practical solutions that people actually use to make platforms like this safe to power on. Thanks.

**[Why is it secretly flipping me off?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1qslo30/why_is_it_secretly_flipping_me_off/)**

Saw this one at Wuhu train station in China. Answers questions at a desk. It looks like it has a lot of ability but it otherwise doesn't move at all. Even when you ask it to wave it says "sure, here's a friendly wave" but doesn't move an inch.

**[Anyone here self-learning robotics (no degree)? Looking to learn together](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1qsojms/anyone_here_selflearning_robotics_no_degree/)**

hey! I’m just starting out in robotics and I’m learning on my own, not through a university or formal degree. I’m super curious about robotics, embedded systems, hardware + software but honestly it can feel pretty overwhelming figuring out where to start and what to focus on I was wondering if anyone else here is in a similar space: - Self-learning robotics - No robotics/engineering degree - Following online courses, yourube, books, projects, arduino/raspberry pi etc - getting stuck a lot but still want to keep going If so, would love to learn together…share resources, small projects, progress updates, failures etc. Maybe a small discord group orsomething if enough people are interested. Skill level doesn’t matter at all. Absolute beginners welcome. The goal is consistency and help eachother learn together If this sounds interesting, please leave a comment about: - What you’re currently learning - What you want to build someday - or just say i want to join thanks 🦾 Edit: I made a small beginner-friendly Discord for learning robotics together. Please join if you are interested. https://discord.gg/qP9pNK2SB

**[First rover build! Resurrected my dad's 5yr old kits and scraps to make this little guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1qsjqlz/first_rover_build_resurrected_my_dads_5yr_old/)**

First time posting here! Ive been messing around with my dad’s scraps for a while, but finally found a rover kit! I built this chassis using a mix of 5-year-old kits and random scraps I had lying around. It was a late night, but getting an actual chassis/frame plus the wiring to work felt amazing. Really really simple build, put it together via an old ESP 32, ( after many cable, Bluetooth pairing, and firmware hassles ) archaic L298N motor driver, and for battery a basic series circuit to up the voltage ( don’t even have batteries sitting haha) I’ve been learning a ton from Practical Electronics for Inventors and The Art of Electronics, but I'm looking for what to tackle next. I’d love to hear your suggestions for: Books that bridge mechanical engineering and embedded systems. Courses on more advanced control (maybe leading into ROS 2?). I’ve played around built software applications with agentic workflows and played around w yolov8 as well. But definitely need more resources on robotics + AI. Let me know if you guys have any tips!!
