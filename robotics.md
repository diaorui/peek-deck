**[Update: Remember my post about upgrading the plastic joints on the Berkeley Lite? The CNC cycloidal parts just arrived.](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1ujmb03/update_remember_my_post_about_upgrading_the/)**

Hey guys. A couple months back I asked this sub for some reality checks on using a 30:1 metal cycloidal to replace 3D printed joints for QDD. The first batch of CNC parts finally showed up. I was honestly expecting the tight machining tolerances to make it bind up, but turning the output flange by hand... the back-drivability is wild. Just for context: we were getting super annoyed with stripping the 3D-printed plastic gears on open-source rigs like the Berkeley Lite and ALOHA. They are awesome projects, but the plastic joints are fragile and a nightmare to maintain. So we designed this as a drop-in replacement (calling it the Starfruit Actuator). Instead of printing two different plastic joint types, we wanted a single unified metal design to simplify the BOM and actually survive dynamic loads. Specs we're rolling with for the final drop: 30:1 ratio (30 teeth, 31 pins) Dual absolute encoders (supports FOC & MIT modes) Fully ODrive-compatible Target price: ~$149 Next up is integrating the motor and driver board, then throwing it on the test bench to see if it survives a 76 Nm torque test without exploding. Fingers crossed lol. Let me know what you think of the machining! All the STEP files, ROS2 nodes, and configs are going to be 100% open source. I'll drop the project link in the comments if anyone wants to track the testing or grab the files when they go live.

**[Synced SLAM cameras for depth + VIO](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1ujtmfq/synced_slam_cameras_for_depth_vio/)**

This is my project, Mighty Camera. It is essentially a monocular SLAM camera running entirely on tiny onboard compute. See my past posts for details. Mighty also supports combining multiple cameras and synchronizing them to produce frame-level synced streams. In this setup, I’m using that hardware synchronization to generate depth with SGBM, while it also produces VIO pose.

**[What is robotics’ “Attention Is All You Need” ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1uj4o7u/what_is_robotics_attention_is_all_you_need/)**

In LLMs, Attention Is All You Need is one of those papers everyone agrees is worth studying. What would be the equivalent in robotic manipulation or computer vision applied to robotics? (Besides Transformers, since that would basically take us back to AIAYN) Not necessarily SOTA with 200 GPUs lol I’m looking for a paper worth reproducing to really learn from it. Which one would you pick, and why?

**[Will this linear actuator design work? I’m a robotics noob](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1ujdyoy/will_this_linear_actuator_design_work_im_a/)**

So I want to perform a material characterization study on a material where I need to put it under pressure. I’m in high school and don’t have a mentor or time to ask for access to university labs so I want to make something that can help me get data for cheap. I’m trying to make a linear actuator design and physically build all the parts myself (except for the motor and leadscrew system obviously) but I don’t extensively know how these types of things work. If I was to build something like this (pictures) would there be any significant issues? The cylinder (of which I don’t know what material to make out of) protruding out from the side would be directly connected to the sliding block part of my linear actuator so it pushes that down onto my material. I’m going to be pushing with 50lbs ish max so I’m making the majority of this out of wood. Any tips on making sure it doesn’t get worn out by some slight imperfection over the thousands of trials I’m going to need it for? And also any tips to make it work if something is seriously wrong 😭 And lastly any other tips about doing research studies like this without lab access or a significant mentor would be greatly appreciated.
