**[If it were at an amusement park, would you want to ride it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1varxei/if_it_were_at_an_amusement_park_would_you_want_to/)**

California-based robotics startup Satyress is developing Threehalves, a 7-foot-tall teleoperated centaur robot designed for hazardous work.But if it’s designed for hazardous tasks, why does it look like something you could ride—something that seems more at home in an amusement park? Although its appearance is a bit creepy lol.

**[What a cheap GPS actually reports vs what you can get out of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vb5nx7/what_a_cheap_gps_actually_reports_vs_what_you_can/)**

Setup: a Raspberry Pi 4B on a small skid-steer chassis, a u-blox NEO-M9N (about $100), a BNO085 IMU, and hall encoders on the wheels. No RTK, no base station, no corrections Orange is pretty much every fix the receiver reported. Blue is the output seen after fusing those fixes with the IMU and wheel odometry in a UKF. Every fix was used, none were rejected in this entire run. What I can and cannot say about this is that, since this is a fair thing to ask: I don't have RTK ground truth for this run, so I can't claim the blue line is closer to the true path than the orange dots are. What I can say is that the filter's reported 1-sigma stayed around 2.5 m throughout, including while moving, and the fused output tracked the raw fixes to a median of 1.69 m. Both of those are self-reported numbers, not error against an independent reference. Other limitations worth stating: it's a single short run covering only about 20 m, there's no comparison against robot_localization on the same data yet, and heading comes from GPS track rather than a magnetometer, so it isn't meaningful for roughly the first minute of driving. The curve in the path is mechanical, the chassis pulls right about 3 deg/s. On the next run I'm closing the loop back to a physically marked start point so there's at least a real closure number, and replaying the same bag through robot_localization so it's a controlled comparison on identical input rather than one filter on its own. Also looking into borrowing an F9P for proper ground truth. Disclosure: I wrote the filter (FusionCore): https://github.com/manankharwar/fusioncore Happy to share the rosbag if anyone wants to run their own filter against it. Edit: rewrote this. Sorry if my english is bad...

**[Google DeepMind announces Gemini Robotics 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vaxn3p/google_deepmind_announces_gemini_robotics_2/)**

Google DeepMind has announced Gemini Robotics 2, its latest robotics foundation models, in early access. The release adds full-body control for humanoid robots, multi-step task execution with the ability to recover from mistakes, natural language communication, multi-robot coordination, on-device deployment, and new safety features that can reject unsafe commands or request human assistance when needed. Google demonstrated the models on Apptronik’s Apollo 2 humanoid, along with dexterous robotic hands and dual-arm systems. The update moves beyond robots performing isolated tasks and toward systems that can complete longer sequences of work while interacting more naturally with people and other robots.

**[[R] Decentralized self-repair for modular robotic structures](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vay0av/r_decentralized_selfrepair_for_modular_robotic/)**

Damage can fragment a modular robotic structure into disconnected pieces. We developed decentralized strategies that allow the surviving modules to consolidate, reorganize, and autonomously restore connectivity without a central controller. Across 1,000 simulated damage scenarios, the system retained at least 80% of surviving modules in its largest connected component even after 30% random failures, with near-perfect reconnection in fully connected cases. The broader goal is to develop machine analogues of homeostasis and morphogenesis: systems that can detect damage, adapt their physical organization, and preserve function. Technical article: https://www.manifoldrg.com/can-a-spacecraft-heal-itself/ Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.13444 I’m one of the authors and would welcome feedback, particularly on the decentralized coordination strategy and the path toward hardware experiments.

**[Testing a Bowden cable drive for a future project](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vb635j/testing_a_bowden_cable_drive_for_a_future_project/)**

I'm exploring Bowden cables as a way to transmit motion when the motor can't be placed near the moving part. This is just a quick setup to see how smoothly it works before designing a larger mechanism. Any suggestions or ideas are welcome.

**[A robot import ban may also be a ban on cheap iteration](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1vakosr/a_robot_import_ban_may_also_be_a_ban_on_cheap/)**

The new US restriction on foreign-made humanoids and quadrupeds is framed around security, but price and availability matter to research velocity. AP reports that Chinese manufacturers ship far more humanoids than US rivals and often at much lower prices. Labs learn by breaking hardware, replacing parts, and running many imperfect prototypes. If the affordable platforms disappear, better-funded companies may adapt while universities, startups, and independent builders reduce experiments or move them abroad. Would a certified research-only pathway preserve security without concentrating access? Or are connected embodied systems too difficult to contain once they enter a lab network?
